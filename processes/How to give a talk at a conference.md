(WIP)

## Submit to a Call For Papers (CFP)


Identify a conference you'd like to speak at. Check the [Community: Conference board on Monday](https://grafana-labs.monday.com/boards/2973436215) and take a look at the priorities. You can't go wrong with submitting to a conference that's Tier 1 or 2. You can also look at the `#cfps` channel on Slack, where the Dev Programs team regularly posts CFPs with upcoming deadlines.
