TL;DR: Everyone on the team can run an Office Hours or Community Call. Here's how!

In a nutshell, all you need to do is:
- Schedule your livestream on [the Monday board](https://grafana-labs.monday.com/boards/5724430500) to prevent anyone from taking that time slot.
- Set up the livestream on YouTube via [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com).
- Promote the stream on socials.
- Send your guests the Streamyard link and hit *Go live*!

How you do these things is really up to your discretion. But here are a few tips of what has worked for us in the past.

## The pitch

### Grafana Office Hours or Community Call?

Consider doing a Grafana Office Hours for topics that:
- are evergreen
- relate to multiple Grafana Labs projects
- discuss a specific use case or case study
- are presented by external or internal speakers
- are more beginner-friendly

Consider doing a Community Call for topics that:
- are highly topical (relate to an upcoming or new feature)
- mostly relate to a single Grafana Labs project (such as Loki)
- are presented by us and someone(s) on the project engineering teams
- skew towards more advanced/in-depth usage so that it's not great for a broader audience

### What's in it for you?

- Use this as an opportunity to learn in public
- Use this as a way to get engineers to say things in public that haven't been said/explained before
- *Don't* use this as a one-and-done piece of content


### Ask the right person

Choose someone you feel comfortable leading and keeping on track. You are driving this.

### Don't say it's a presentation

Say you'll ask them questions about things they already know. Try to make it so that your guest(s) don't have to prep all that much.



## The prep

Follow [the Grafana Office Hours checklist here](../templates/GOH%20checklist.md). For an example of how this looks like when filled out: [GOH 26 - How to do continuous profiling right, with Grafana Pyroscope & Ryan Perry](../projects/Grafana%20Office%20Hours/GOH%2026%20-%20How%20to%20do%20continuous%20profiling%20right,%20with%20Grafana%20Pyroscope%20&%20Ryan%20Perry.md).

Research!


## The call

- Time 
- Topics
	- Ask them questions they know the answers to
- Conversational cadence and turn-taking
	- Use visual, then verbal cues to encourage quiet people to speak up
- Ask "why" a lot.

## The aftermath

- Post-production on YouTube
- Update docs (even if it's just to embed videos)
- Reuse when possible
	- Shorts
	- Long-form videos on YouTube
- David's LLM tooling
	- Summarise, outline for blog post
	- Ask Grot on website (it will remember transcripts)
