This page summarizes the processes and tools that we use to create videos at Developer Advocacy within Grafana Labs.

## Types of videos

Most videos we create are for [the Grafana YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@grafana):
- shorts
- long-form videos
- livestreams
	- Office Hours
	- Community Calls

We're not the only ones that post videos on our YouTube channel. In fact, the channel is owned by Belyn Lai from Marketing, but we're always welcome to post videos there!

### Shorts

We haven't really done many shorts yet, [but here they are](https://www.youtube.com/@Grafana/shorts). Shorts are quick (up to 1 minute) *vertical* videos that live in a different section on YouTube and are basically YouTube's answer to TikTok. Shorts are different from "long-form" videos in a few key ways:
- Shorts have a more candid feel and tend to be less heavily produced. Consider using your phone camera and no mics to make it feel more organic.
- The shorter duration forces you to focus on one or two key points.
- Shorts loop when they're played in YouTube by default: at the end of the short, it plays again unless a user swipes up to the next one. To take advantage of this, consider tying the end of your short to the beginning so it makes sense when it's played this way.
- Shorts are vertical, so a screen recording of a typical laptop screen in landscape mode uses too little of the screen. Instead, consider flipping your phone camera around and filming your screen for a raw feel that takes advantage of the vertical real estate.

Here are some ways you could create shorts:
- Take a clippable moment from a longer video and re-export it in the right (vertical) format.
- Interview interesting people/speakers at a conference and ask them to pitch their talk in less than a minute.
- Post videos about Grafanista culture to show we're human!
- Announce Grafana's presence at important conferences.
- Explain a beginner concept concisely.


### Long-form Videos

These don't really have to be "long", but I'm calling them that to distinguish from shorts.

Videos that do well on YouTube are a little different from educational videos. Here are some unique considerations for YouTube videos:
- Titles and thumbnails are more important than anything else.
- The consistency of uploads matters (at least one a week).
- Chapters make it easier to jump around within a video.
- Successful videos are more personable than corporate.

### Livestreams

A livestream is a video broadcast, and it's different from pre-recorded and pre-edited YouTube videos in the following ways:
- Livestreams tend to be longer and less structured.
- The expectations in terms of technical quality are lower, because people are more forgiving when something is live.
- Streaming is easier done with guests that can keep up a conversation.
- During a livestream, you need to be able to read and respond to comments, so there's more multitasking involved.
- The live format means that there is a greater chance of demos failing or the subject of conversation changing.

We have two types of streams at Grafana:
- [Grafana Office Hours Readme](projects/Grafana%20Office%20Hours/Grafana%20Office%20Hours%20Readme.md) is a weekly livestream where we invite internal or external guests to talk about use cases for projects in the Grafana stack as well as observability best practices. We can talk about both OSS and Cloud offerings. It started as [k6 Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPyI8rM3LvE&list=PLJdv3RhAQXNE1TFXn2pp9h_Ul1q_kJrEZ)) but we adopted it into [Grafana Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDGkOdUX1Ujrrse-cdj20RRah9hyHdxBu) when k6 was acquired by Grafana.
- [Community Calls](projects/Loki%20Community%20Calls/Loki%20Community%20Calls.md) are livestreams to be held once every cycle (8 weeks). Unlike Office Hours, their focus is on and new features in the latest project release. They are open to the wider user community, and users will be able to ask questions live. This used to be Google Meet links and still is for some projects, but Nicole and Jay revamped [the Loki Community Call](https://gra.fan/lokicclist) recently to align more closely with the Office Hours format, and Mat Ryer relaunched the Grafana Community Calls as [Grafana Campfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FgSP2MIjxo).

Something we only briefly dabbled in at k6, but at Grafana is Twitch streams-- mostly because we don't know who has access to the Grafana Twitch account.
Impromptu streams can give a glimpse into someone's daily work in an unstructured way. Unlike the other two types of streams, impromptu streams are not promoted and are solely stored on Twitch. They are low-effort and low return, but are the most authentic types of streams.

## Tools

### Pre-production

- Thumbnail creation: [Canva](https://canva.com), [ThumbsUp](https://thumbsup.tv)
- Title research: [TubeBuddy](https://www.tubebuddy.com/)
- Scripting: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), pushed to GitHub for reviews

### Filming

The team is too small to have a need to standardize on videography gear, so right now, people choose their own tools and either pay for it themselves or get Grafana Labs to reimburse the expenses.
