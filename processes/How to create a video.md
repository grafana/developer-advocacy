This page summarizes the processes and tools that we use to create videos at Developer Advocacy within Grafana Labs.

## Types of videos

Most videos we create are for [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@grafana):
- shorts
- long-form videos
- tutorials
- livestreams

### YouTube videos

Videos that do well on YouTube are a little different from educational videos. Here are some unique considerations for YouTube videos:
- Titles and thumbnails are more important than anything else.
- The consistency of uploads matters (at least one a week).
- Chapters make it easier to jump around within a video.
- Successful videos are more personable than corporate.

### Livestreams

A livestream is a video broadcast, and it's different from pre-recorded and pre-edited YouTube videos in the following ways:
- Livestreams tend to be longer and less structured.
- The expectations in terms of technical quality are lower, because people are more forgiving when something is live.
- Streaming is easier done with guests that can keep up a conversation.
- During a livestream, you need to be able to read and respond to comments, so there's more multitasking involved.
- The live format means that there is a greater chance of demos failing or the subject of conversation changing.

We have three types of streams at k6:
- [k6 Office Hours](Projects/Office%20Hours/k6%20Office%20Hours.md) is a weekly livestream where we invite internal or external guests to talk about use cases for k6 and performance testing best practices. It usually involves practical demos and conversation around k6 extensions or broader applications of k6 (both OSS and Cloud). ([Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPyI8rM3LvE&list=PLJdv3RhAQXNE1TFXn2pp9h_Ul1q_kJrEZ))
- [Community Call](Community%20Call.md) is a livestream to be held once every cycle (8 weeks). Unlike Office Hours, its focus is on k6 OSS and new features in the latest release. It will be open to the wider k6 user community, and users will be able to ask questions on the call.
- Impromptu streams occur when someone wants to give a glimpse into their daily work in an unstructured way. Unlike the other two types of streams, impromptu streams are not promoted and are solely stored on Twitch. They are low-effort and low return, but are the most authentic types of streams.

### Tutorial videos

We haven't started creating these, but tutorial videos are different from YouTube videos in a few ways:
- It is less about an individual's personality or experience, and more about the product. 
- Voiceovers are the norm, and if there is a person's face in the video, it's probably in a PIP (Picture In Picture).
- Tutorial videos are the shortest type of video, as they have the most limited scope.
- They are primarily educational, and show how to use k6 (OSS or Cloud).

## Tools

### Pre-production

- Thumbnail creation: [Canva](https://canva.com), [ThumbsUp](https://thumbsup.tv)
- Title research: [TubeBuddy](https://www.tubebuddy.com/)
- Scripting: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), pushed to GitHub for reviews

### Filming

The team is too small to have a need to standardize on videography gear, so right now, people choose their own tools and either pay for it themselves or get Grafana Labs to reimburse the expenses.

LEANDRO'S ORIGINAL NOTE

## Check list

- Work in the folder available in this [shared Grafana GDrive ExplainerVideos folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1VLT46sWItUP2jGAt3XJbTPqC0nzVFgJj)
- The folder has 2 sub folders
    - Explainer templates - The resources that should be used in the videos
    - Videos - The list of videos in process
- Create a new folder inside of the "Videos" folder and name it with the video description
- Copy from the ExplainerVideos/ExplainerTemplates folder the ScriptTemplate file into your newly created folder and rename it as the video/episode title.
- Inside the file you just copied, as you progress you can update the marked elements such as video title, YouTube video Description, Cards, etc.
    - SCRIPT: Use the example script to write what you will say in your video. This can be used later as a guide or a teleprompter text.
    - TITLE: Review with the video team what is the best title for your video. This can be pasted verbatim.
