Transcript: Hey, let's talk about the redesign of the
Grafana sharing experience in dashboards - available in all editions
on Grafana version 11.5. I'm Natacha, and I'm the product designer
on the Sharing Squad at Grafana Labs. What problem does the redesign
sharing feature solve? Well, the current sharing model in dashboards
presents various sharing options like links, snapshots, export, PDF, and public dashboards without considering
the user specific sharing needs leading to a sub-optimal user experience. So we created a new solution to avoid
confusion in these sharing options and provide a clear user-focused experience
that simplifies the process and classifies them in an intuitive way. So
how does it work? My colleague, Juan, will show you. I'm Juani Cabanas, senior software engineer on the
Sharing Squad at Grafana Labs. So you have a dashboard with data you
want to share with your team. To do that, you need to click the share button
drop-down, click on share internally, customize the link you
want to share, and copy it. Keep in mind that these settings
are saved in your browser, so next time you can quickly click the
share button and get the link with the settings already applied. Now, if you want to share this dashboard
with a wider audience that don't have access through authentication,
you can opt for sharing externally. You need to accept that the entire
dashboard will be public and there it is. A dashboard that can be shared
with anyone with a link is available. Additionally, you can revoke
access or pause access at any time, so even if someone has the link, they won't be able to access
the dashboard anymore. You can always resume access
or create a new link for public sharing later. You can also create a report for this
dashboard by clicking schedule report button inside the share drop-down list. Or if you would like to create
a snapshot for this dashboard, you can click the share snapshot option,
customize it, and create a snapshot. You can also share visualizations
as downloadable files such as PDF or TXT file. Here you can
select under the export option menu, the export as PDF, where you can
customize the orientation, the layout, the zoom with a preview, where
you can generate your PDF, and then download it. Also, you can share a dashboard
as a JSON file where you can use this in another instance by
copying this or downloading the file. Another thing that we did was redesigning
the panel sharing experience where you can see now this menu where you have share link for internal use the
share embed be as an iframe or share a snapshot. Now you can find the library panel
option under the more action menu here, since it's only
relevant in edit mode. Now check out the What's New page to
learn more about these updates. Thank you.
