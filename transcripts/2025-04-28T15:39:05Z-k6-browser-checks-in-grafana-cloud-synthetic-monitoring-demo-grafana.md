Transcript: Hello everyone. I'm very excited to introduce you to the new Ksix browser checks in synthetic monitoring. I'm Vika and I'm a software engineer in the synthetics team here at Graphana Labs. So up until now, Grafana cloud synthetic monitoring only supported test at the protocol level. Now using the power of Ksix and the Ksix browser module, you can create synthetic monitoring tests that interact with a real browser environment. This means you can control a headless Chrome browser using a GIC script to gather insights on web by capture custom performance metrics and simulate user actions like clicking buttons or filling out forms. So how does it work? Let's take a look now. We can create a new browser check by following the same process as we do with other checks in synthetic monitoring. So now we have this new create browser check button that we can click to get started. First let's fill out the job name and the instance. And the next step is to uh write the script that we want to be executed on every test run. Um the check comes with an example script that we can use as a starting point. We could also choose one of the scripts from this examples list or we can create one from scratch. So the script that we are using here logs in into a site. It also adds an assertion to make sure that the login works and it performs a few other interactions like creating a new object in that site and then deleting it. Um this script is also available in the documentation. So you might check it out there in detail if you are interested and it's worth to mention that K6 browser tests are compatible with the playright API. So if you already know playright browser synthetics are going to feel very familiar and because browser synthetics are powered by Ksix this script can also run in Ksix command line interface and you can also run it in graphite cloud Ksix. Okay, so let's let's continue with the creation flow. Let's leave these fields in their default values for this demo. And finally, let's choose the prop location where we run we want it to be run from. Let's now save it. And as you can see, setting up the checks is pretty straightforward. Now we can analyze the results um by taking a look at the dashboard that was generated for us. So in this dashboard you will find all the metrics you need to assess your application's performance and user experience. So besides uptime and reachability, we also display web vital information for page loading times, interactivity and visual stability. We can also analyze the user journey by checking out this new metrics by URL table where we display web vital information for each of the URLs that were accessed during the test. And just like for scripted checks, we display all the assertions that were set in the test with all the the information for that. the number of distinct targets, duration by prog, which in our case was just Paris, information about data sent and received, and as well a list of blogs. So to dive deeper into this new feature, be sure to check out our what's new blog post and the official documentation on the graphana doc site. You will find scripted samples and detailed guidance to help you get started. So try that for yourself and see how browser checks can enhance your monitoring capabilities. Thanks.
