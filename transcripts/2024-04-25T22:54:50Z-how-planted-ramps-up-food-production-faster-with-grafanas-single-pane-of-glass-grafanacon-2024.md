Transcript: [Applause] thank you so grafana 11 is looking pretty cool now I really like the new metric explore feature now I have the not so easy task of giving the talk right after the Deep dive with you all probably already dreaming about what you can build with the new grafana luckily I have a bit of an unusual topic for grafana grafana is a lot about fancy technology tracing for microservices or moonlandings I have a bit more downto Earth topic making food and how we make it better using grafana to introduce I think we're not quite there yet on the technical side I'll do it hour like this cool thank you so to introduce you to the uh to the area of food processing I picked the example of coffee after all this is a Tech conference so I think most of you are aware of coffee some maybe a little bit too well well a food process starts with a natural input material in this case the uh the coffee fruit and we can characterize certain properties of it like the the redness the color or it's water content thank you then in the next step we apply processing to it with parameters like um roasting duration and roasting temperature and in the end we get the final product product which we can characterize with like the acidity or the Crea the consistency of the Crea now the challenge in food processing is to find the parameters that lead to the desired properties in your final product while having to deal with variations in the input material from Harvest to harvest now I'm not in the coffee business I work for planted we make plant-based meat with amazing taste and texture and I think plant-based meat is a very interesting industry to be in right now because when it comes to their food habits reducing meat consumption is top of mind for a lot of C uh consumers out there and there are various motivations for that sustainability climate change personal health and of course Animal Welfare now naturally this leads to a market with a lot of companies out there trying to help these consumers to make that transition so we are in a quite young still booming Industries with so many players so the the rate of new products coming to Market is quite cool quite good and so plant-based meat today is much better than it was 3 years ago and it's still improving at a great rate what set planted apart in this market is that we achieve our taste and texture without the use of artificial ingredients instead we rely on Science and Technology like fermentation and Extrusion to to give these plant-based proteins the texture we want so we are a technology leader in the space and of course we want to stay one so what does that mean for us we have to be able to bring new products to the market and bringing products to the market requires two things well first of all you need a good idea in the lab but then and this is often overlooked you also need the ability to bring that idea to Market to hit the volumes that you uh that you need to be Nationwide in stores or even internationally what you see here on this screen or in these pictures is essentially the same machine twice it's an extruder on the left it's a bit more the the lab scale and on the right it's the essentially the the left half of the of the uh of the room so how do we go from left to right that's the question I want to talk about with you and how we make it faster well now I'm going to ask question that every software engineer laughes how hard can it be in our case just get a bigger machine well it's not that easy let's go back to my coffee example from the start let's say you were working in your kitchen you found a new way to make coffee grind it in a nice way it tastes really good and you want to Delight the world and bring it to scale well in your kitchen you had this machine and now in your factory you suddenly stand in front of that monster so the parameters you had at the small scale are not necessarily going to translate well to the bigger scale and just in general it's a very complicated problem you might have 30 40 parameters on that machine with a lot of interdependencies and the Subspace of this parameter room in which you get good quality is quite small so how do people find the correct process parameters to achieve great quality it's good old trial and error to take the coffee example once more let's say you are a barista at home you got yourself a coffee machine you set it up you make your first coffee tastes awful then you change one of the parameters let's say water temperature another coffee is still bad you change another parameter to grind size and so on and after a while you have a great coffee but your hands are also shaking because you just had 10 shots of espresso the next time you you change something on your setup like you get a new coffee bean supplier you might remember something from the last time you remember how some parameters affect the output so you get to the good coffee in only five shots and that is essentially what is happening at an industrial scale just with a few more parameters now we were asked okay how can we make this this ramp up process quicker because we're going to go through it a lot with each new product we bring to Market and we thought or we we think there are a lot of um um parallels between the software world and the manufacturing world because when you look at it what you do when you set up a production is you design a system you think it's going to work you put it into production and then in some Cas cases it's not quite working and suddenly you have to fix it while there's a bunch of people standing behind you watching impatiently over your shoulder if you have have ever had to fix a bug in production I think you know the situation and if you have to fix bucks in production what you want is observability you need to know what's going on and it's the same thing in manufacturing we think so what's the state yeah faster debuging so what's the state of observability in manufacturing to answer that question we first need to look at the difference between OT and it I think you're all aware of it OT means operational technology and it's all the the compute that is necessary to run physical processes so the controllers on the machines and these two industries have been moving at different speeds in OT the Mantra is never change a running system and in it some of you are deploying multiple times per day the other thing is in the it sector there has been a huge investment into tools uh to make developers more productive over the last 25 years and this is starting to show in OT the analytics capabilities are very limited so what people do is they get the data on a thumb drive they put it into Excel they analyze it there and then you have Exel everywhere and it's yeah you know the situation well while in the it sector we have really great tools so we decided okay we need to get our data out of this OT world so we have access to all the Innovation that has been happening in the it sector and that's what we did the first thing we did is we B we built dashboards for our um process Engineers where they can now dynamically analyze um the the signals from the machines to do cause and effect analysis and these dashboards are growing and they are they're huge a bit too big for my taste but uh the process Engineers really like them then we took it a step further because when you think about a ramp up a great metric in a ramp up is repeatability you run your process today you run it again tomorrow and you want to behave have it behave similarly if you achieve that then you have a stable process to to visualize this it's great to to plot these different production runs over each other unfortunately that's a bit difficult with the standard grafana because grafana works well for streaming data where you have absolute time on the x-axis in a batch process you're not interested in absolute time you're interested in relative time so how many hours since the start of the process luckily with the plug-in system and some great open source uh work from wov Labs we were able to do that using the echarts plug-in I just noticed I think this right here is the variable plugin from ROV so that's also from them them so thanks for that good um planted is a bit unusual in the food space because we have science engineering and production in one house a lot of companies try to Outsource production but we think it's great for Innovation to have this all in the same building so we have easy communication but this setup will only pay off if the communication actually takes place and to facilitate it it's important that data can flow between these different teams and gaana is a great means to to make this exchange happen to get production data back to science or engineering so now we've talked a bit about how we use kafana for our Engineers but a ramp up is not a pure engineering challenge there are other parts of the company involved as well sales needs to know how it's going how are the quantities so they can talk to their customers who are waiting for the product um management needs to to know how it's going so they so they can take decisions so basically they all come to the uh to the production team with one question how is it going well the traditional way of answering this is somebody gets out an Exel they copy paste a bunch of data together then they send an email and there's a lot of control C control V magic involved and it's not that great because data is outdated the minute you send that email and nobody likes to do it with grafana it is quite easy to bring disparate data sources together so you can share that um that dashboard people have access to to live data and it saves a bit of time on the reporting part but what I think is more important is that it improves decision making because people have easier and better access to data and that's what we're building right now now the third challenge during a ramp up it's not really a challenge it's actually something nice is as you go along you notice things that you can improve you you no this potential well the fastest way to realize this potential is if we can do it in-house because if you rely on suppliers you have to wait for um yeah a few weeks for their lead time sometimes month so we try to do it in in house as much as possible an example for that is adding sensing so we noticed for example that in one process it was interesting to to understand what's going on to have pictures of it what we did is we hooked up a camera there and we have a button in the dashboard and people can click that button then a picture is taken and we can already connect it with the sensor data at that point in time right out of grafana the next thing is we have a bunch of machines that allow remote control but they don't come with a UI to send these commands so we thought okay where do we put now this this this command uh this option to send the commands well our users are already inside of grafana to analyze the data so it makes sense that from that very point they can act then on that data so that it's nicely integrated from a single application the next use case is we have machines where you can dynamically position the sensors the unfortunate part is that the machine does not come with a way to track where these sensors were when the reason behind that is that a lot of Manufacturers live um let's say a bit in the moment when it comes to data they want the operator to know in that moment what it's happening but the data from yesterday or the week before they don't care really anymore but for us as we are trying to push these processes to to the Limit we really want to understand what's going on so we need to track that data so what we did is we built an operator dashboard for that machine in grafana and our operators can use this it's very simple for them they decide ah okay let's put here put a sensor in that one then we have some business logic to to a bit of shuffling that we do and we have the the data annotation taken care of and the operator can from inside grafana see how is the process going uh our process Engineers can analyze how we can maybe improve it and so on now we're unloading yeah I think you get the idea well now if you go a bit further in the production life cycle even when you're are producing let's say normal operation there will still be issues it's like a software system you will still occasionally have the incident and then the only question is how fast do you detect that you have an incident and how fast and reliably can you resolve it well we are already ingesting all that data 10 million measurements per day and we can run analysis on top of it and detect that we have an issue but we don't stop there when we detect the issue we notify the operator and we also send them instructions on how to act on it so they see here run through these five steps to resolve it and this enables us to have standardization across operators because they all get the same steps they don't have to like come up with ways to fix this they can just go with the with it now some of you might be thinking isn't this pushing grafana a bit we are quite far away from the from the core from the normal use case of monitoring and I agree with that normally you should use a tool in the way it is intended to be used but I think in our case we have a lot of benefits from it whereas still a fairly small company and the the the data team is small so we need to keep our Tex de small and manageable but what is even more important is from the perspective of the users we don't want to have for them 10 applications they have to log in we try to keep it that they can do a lot from a single application and I think we can do this in a robust way in grafana thanks to its plug-in system so to summarize this a bit at the beginning we talked about the the market situation the need to to innovate to stay a technology leader told you that uh we believe that having these smart factories where we can take datadriven decisions enables us to take faster and better decisions so we can reliably outrun the competition in the long term and grafana plays an important role in that and I think what I tried to show with this this uh talk is that gaana is not just a monitoring tool for software it goes beyond that it goes beyond software to something like food making and it goes beyond monitoring um you can control machines through graph you can annotate data now I hope you had a great lunch otherwise you might get hungry now but of course I wanted to show you what's the result of all that work it's our latest product the steak look at that juiciness and the fibers [Applause] good now the the most important slide um it's great to work with people who are not from the software industry because for them something like grafana is really something new and magical like we have our food science team someone from the it they had a new process and it was their baby and they were really excited about gaana because the process runs during the night they were like now I can watch what's going on during the night I won't be able to sleep and of course big thanks to my team the smart Factory team Marco Naja and Georgia they are also here in the audience um they made this all possible [Applause]
