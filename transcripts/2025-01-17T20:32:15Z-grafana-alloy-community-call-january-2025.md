Transcript: hello everybody and welcome to the January Community call for Al so um for the past few we've changed the format a bit from kind of a more rigid we present something and then talk about it to more of just a Q&A or talk about things so um so y we will start off just opening up if anybody has any questions comments um just want to chat about something um we got a fair amount of graphon people on here and more than happy to answer any questions you can raise your hand you can type them in chat whatever you need to do to uh ask your question so we'll open up the floor if not I can add a little filler here until unless anybody thinks of anything I had I had a question regarding the remote configuration it's in public preview how's that going so far because it looks like something we might be interested in absolutely um we don't have anyone from Al the fleet management team here but we're adjacent enough I can probably give a good overview uh it's going really well um I know we're starting to stress test it with like over thousands of um you know alloy instances connecting for a single tenant um I'm kind of working out making sure that we're not hitting any issues there um I'm not exactly sure when they're looking to G it U my guess is they're going to want some more data um and kind um if I was to make an educated uh semi gas I bet it would have line somewhere around like an Ops that's just my bet but that depends entirely on how the ga goes um is there so right now it's seems to be pretty stable we have a lot of people using it um is it not being GA a blocker or you just wanting to be ensured that it's um stable it's not a block I just noticed it for the first time I kind of tried grafana angine out a a while ago and now we're pivoting to trying grafana alloy and when I pulled up the Local Host one two three four five I was like what is that and then started researching and I thought oh that's pretty slick Fleet Management very cool um and then I saw that it was in public preview so I was just curious yep uh if you're interested trying it you can reach up through customer support if you're it's only available for graphon cloud so it's not OS feature inherently what we're offering the protocols and specs are um open apis um but of course uh they're not necessarily we don't have a a reference server although I think someone is working like a external contributor might be working on that um but yeah if you're found a cloud user reach out to customer support um I think we'd be more than happy to probably throw you in uh if you want to try it out and it's you know uh like you can try it out if it doesn't work you don't always it to the old configuration cool thank you cool uh does anyone have anything else I'd like to chat about I would have a potential maybe filler topic While others think of of questions that they may have um do we want to talk at all about the upcoming one6 release um any of the goodies that might be coming or rough timeline for release yeah I'm The Shepherd of that uh which kind of important since I'm the one doing on the socket but I am the shepherd for this release uh yeah we're shooting for so timeline wise we're shooting for next week um I got pulled into some other stuff and I'm hoping to have a draft ready on Friday but I don't like releasing new versions of software on Friday um especially when I might be on call it looked but I'd rather not so we're shooting for Monday or Tuesday as far as Mo it's a pretty big one I think because of dis I don't know felt like a lot of stuff is in this one um I think some of the big things are around performance um obviously updating wel tet Tre yeah Fridays are read only that is a a good statement um one that was a pretty big change is adding the off to just a ton of open Telemetry um components um I think there was an outside contribution so that was great uh apologies I don't remember who did it offand I could probably at the change log here um but that was a pretty big PR um and it's pretty cool um we have some experimental stuff I have a a different wall that I wrote that's in very very very experimental uh don't use it and unless you really want to or use it in Dev don't use it in fraud um but if anyone does it I would love to hear feedback um William Sam anything that kind of big that you can think of that we had in here oh support bundles fam about that yeah support bundles were public preview in one five one or maybe five and now uh GA and six but basically just a great way if you have a support case an issue coming up for Gathering a lot of useful data it gathers logs for about 60 seconds it gathers you know a variety of different configuration information environment variables um and then also some profiles with prpr so just a nice little bundle of hey we've got an issue here's just everything that you might need to to start with that support ticket um or or with a GitHub issue or anything like that um so yeah uh good documentation fors out there pretty straightforward to use uh so yeah if you see anything that um you think would be a great addition to that I know William at some point wants to get uh some some live debugging uh added to that bundle um but uh yeah should be a good starting point for anybody who's running into an issue and wants some support another thing in six that I worked on I know Matt mentioned open Telemetry components we had a couple requests from different customers for basically uh different C log support um where maybe they want to send a lot of their information to Loki but they want to you know replicate some of their messages via CIS log to a security system a Sim um and so we pulled in the open Telemetry receiver and exporter for CIS log um there wasn't a great pattern to use the the low-key CIS log receiver lowkey sorry CIS log source to then the open Telemetry syis log exporter because of the different way they handle labeling Logs with the CIS log information so this allows just kind of pure proc seeing of CIS log messages and then you know in your pipeline between you figure out how to shunt off the ones these ones that want them going to lowkey and process this way these ones I just want them just proxied straight to our our security solution so uh we had a couple different requests for that so hopefully that's uh useful for somebody speaking of live debugging uh William I think we had quite a few changes even from some external contributors you want to go over those real quick yeah yeah sure um so we we're developing liveing a bit more because now it's GA and it seems like very valuable to troubleshoot uh the alloy collector so we're extending it to more components so I think with 1.6 it will be extended to all the discovery components and we're currently working on any it for primitive scrape and uh remote R and we are there is a a new feature coming maybe based on the life diing which will be a live diing graph so you see in the UI currently you have just like a basic static graph but we're also working on a graph where you see actually the data like moving through your pipeline so you see a bit more what your collector is doing so that's why in this one uh there is a bit more of Life debugging coming um and another uh otel receiver is added also it's the soles one so if you're using solay then you can get Now using thisel receiver some Telemetry data from it um if I don't know what live debugging is can you give me like a little little description of maybe what it is and how it's enabled uh yeah sure so live typing allows you to like Peak into uh your your component and see the data that's passing through like so you see the data after it's been processed by the component so it's disabled by default but to enable it you just need to add in your config a little live debugging block with um the argument enabled s to true and then you can simply go to the alloy UI so Local 1 2 3 4 5 and from there um you can click on the components that you want to debug and on the component detail page you will have a little button if it's available for this component which is live debugging and once you click then you receive a live feed of the data that's passing through and being processed by this comp component so for most of the components you will see just a text format of metrix logs or traces and for some specific components for example like the the Rel label prus Rebel component you will see the set of labels before the processing and the set of label after the processing it's very useful for the these kind of components because it's it's not always trivial to set this relabeling rule same thing for otel with the transform so it's very yeah very useful to see it before and after and make sure that it's doing um what you want uh live ding is currently experimental do you know when that will be ga uh yeah I think it's so I thought it was with it was already but maybe it's with 1.6 I have to check the CH 1.6 at least according to the change log oh okay then then it comes with with this uh the release planed for for Monday uh we live the we show details for OTP exporters um yeah so currently we don't really have it on components that are like at the end of the PIP plan um but uh I think I think we will add it uh because also we might want to add it in in the live graph but it's it's it would be it's a little bit different because like for other components that are like part of the pipeline then we can really get the data after when it exit the components whereas here it's yeah we have to see what kind of data we put so whether we just put the data that will be sent or we put maybe a little bit more information about whether the scent was successful so only the data that was that made it for example I I don't know uh yet cool um yeah kind of grow looking over the features that seems to be kind of some of the Marquee ones unless anyone has a specific feature they want to talk about uh do we have any more questions or other topics all right if no one has anything else we'll call it early and I appreciate everybody showing up asking some questions and we'll see you all in about a month tell everybody bye everybody thank you
