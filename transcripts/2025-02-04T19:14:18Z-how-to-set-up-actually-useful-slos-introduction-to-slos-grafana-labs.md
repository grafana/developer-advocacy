Transcript: Are your service level objectives,
just numbers on a dashboard, or are they actually helping your team
deliver value? If they're the former, you're not alone. Hi, I'm Jake Swiss on
the Grafana Labs product marketing team. In this video, I'll show you how to set up actually
useful SLOs in three simple steps, which will align your team's efforts
with real business outcomes. Step one, understand what really matters. SLOs are only useful when they align
with your business goals and your customer's expectations. The first step is identifying
what's important to your
users and reflecting that in your SLOs. For example, let's
say you run an e-commerce app. Your customers likely care about
a fast checkout experience, so your SLO should reflect
that like aiming for a 99.9% success rate for
transactions under two seconds. By aligning your SLOs with
these user priorities, you ensure your team is focused
on the right outcomes. Step two, define clear measurable targets.
Now that you know what matters, you need to set clear targets that
push your team to deliver value, but are still realistic. This is where metrics like
red metrics come into play. Red metrics or rate errors
and duration are useful here. Let's say your goal is to
ensure smooth API performance. A clear target could be 95%
of API requests respond within 300 milliseconds. This
is specific, measurable, and something that your team can track.
Also, this should be a realistic value, one that the team can achieve. The
more concrete your targets are, the more actionable they
will become. Step three, continuous iteration and fine tuning. Setting up SLOs isn't a
set it and forget it task. It's a process that evolves as your
users business goals and services change. Regularly review your SLOs to ensure
they're still aligned with users' expectations. Use historical data
to adjust targets and refine error budgets. For example, you might find that 95% of requests
under 300 milliseconds is too conservative or not
ambitious enough. Also, gather feedback from your team. If an SLO isn't helping
them make better decisions, it might need some rethinking.
Finally, keep iterating on your SLOs. It'll keep them relevant, actionable,
and impactful over time. To recap: to create actually useful SLOs, focus
on what matters to your customers. Set clear and measurable targets
and keep iterating over time. Want to dive deeper into SLOs? Check out the blog and
