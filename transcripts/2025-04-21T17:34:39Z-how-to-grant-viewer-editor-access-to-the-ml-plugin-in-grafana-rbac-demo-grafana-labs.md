I'm engineer on the AI/ML squad, and today I'm talking to you
about RBAC feature inside of the ML plugin. This is

the way down to plugin roll. Click on ML Viewer apply. Great. Now we have access to the plugin so viewers can view both forecasting and outlier jobs, but not allowed to edit them. Let's go ahead and give this user the editor role. Great. So now we can see
that this user now has edit and create access for metric forecast as well as alert detection.
