## Summary

In this video, the speakers discuss the integration of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the understanding of flame graphs, which they find challenging to interpret. They highlight how LLMs can generate more accessible explanations for these complex profiles, making them easier to comprehend for those unfamiliar with the concept. One of the speakers emphasizes that this new method of transforming flame graphs into a textual format for summarization by LLMs significantly improves the learning process compared to traditional methods. Overall, the video explores the innovative approach to simplifying data visualization through the use of AI technology.

For example, we were generating explanations for profile flame graphs, which I personally find really hard to understand. The LLMs were helpful in creating more human-understandable explanations, making it easier to work with profiles and reducing the barrier to entry.

This feature is phenomenal! If you don't know about flame graphs, this is actually a better way to learn than what we had before. There’s something remarkable about how this was done: they essentially turned the flame graph into a textual representation of the data and then provided that to the LLM to summarize.

So for example here uh we we were generating uh explanations for uh profiles flame graphs which personally I find really hard to to understand what's going on and the LLMs were were helping like to generate a more human uh understandable explanation uh making it working with profiles uh less of a a barrier Um and we also >> yeah sorry yeah this is this was this feature is just phenomenal like um you know literally if you don't know about flame graphs you this is how you could learn this is actually a better way to learn I think than whatever we had before and there's also I think something about the way that this the way that they did this uh which was essentially turn the flame graph into a textual representation uh of of that data and then give that to of the LLM and ask it to summarize.
