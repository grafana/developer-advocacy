Transcript: In this video, I'll show you how you can
visualize monitoring metrics
from Datadog with Grafana Cloud. Using the Datadog
plugin and Grafana Cloud, you can visualize observability data
from all of your observability tools in a single place. First,
navigate to Grafana Cloud. Click Connect Data and search for
Datadog amongst a library of hundreds of plugins. Next, we'll
install the Datadog plugin, choose your organization and
click Install Plugin. Next, navigate to Datadog and create an API
and application key as outlined in the documentation. To visualize
monitoring metrics stored in Datadog, we'll configure a Datadog data source.
First, select the region of Datadog, which you're using, and follow these links to go directly
into Datadog to generate an API and application key. Then click Save and test. One of the great parts about this plugin
is it includes dashboards out of the box, so we'll go ahead and import those. Now in a matter of minutes, we're
able to understand system metrics, Disk I/O, container health,
and even our Datadog monitors. Now that these metrics are
accessible via Grafana Cloud, you can create dashboards like this one, which give you a complete end-to-end
picture of your environment, regardless of which observability
tools are used. At Grafana Labs, we embrace what we call
our Big Tent strategy, allowing you to view data from all of
your observability tools in a single place. The Datadog plugin is now
available in Grafana Cloud free accounts. Get started with the Datadog
plugin and Grafana Cloud today.
