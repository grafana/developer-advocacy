## Summary

In this video, the speaker shares their experience of attempting to create a candle monitoring system to track PM particles released when a candle is extinguished and to check if a candle is still burning while away from home. They discuss the potential safety hazards of the project, including a fire incident caused by using a wooden lid during testing. The conversation highlights the lessons learned about the dangers of working with fire and the importance of safety precautions, as well as the challenges faced during the project.

00:03:30 Importance of safety when experimenting with fire  
00:04:00 Conclusion on the project’s abandonment  
00:04:30 Final thoughts on candle monitoring ideas  

So, once, I tried to build a candle monitoring system. I was monitoring how much PM particles go into the air when you shut it off. I also wanted to know if the candle was still on after I left the house. Then I had the idea that if it was on, I could just shut it down remotely. 

However, it caught on fire while I was out of the house. Luckily, this was just a testing phase. I had a wooden lid that I was trying to use. 

So, what did I learn? I learned that you shouldn't mess with fire when you are outside of your apartment. Nice.
