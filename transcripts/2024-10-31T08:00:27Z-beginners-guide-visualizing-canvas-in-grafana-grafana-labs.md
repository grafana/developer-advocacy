Transcript: hello Graphics do you have crazy ideas or a wild business need that graph visualizations can't display then you're in the right place today we are going to be driving into grafana canvas panel Graf's most flexible visualization so let's get started on this creative journey [Music] together grafana canvas visualization is a powerful and flexible tool that allows you to create custom visualizations from drawing basic shapes and adding text to binding data to interactive elements and importing animated images the possibilities are endless and in this video we will talk through the process of setting up canvas panels and discuss the data needs explore various customization options and by the end you'll have the know how to craft stunning and highly functional canvas visualizations [Music] we will start by using grafana play for this demonstration but the steps will be the same on your local grafana instance to access grafana Play click the link in the corner grafana plays home screen is a dashboard follow these steps to add a new panel next select canas from the list of panel types now we have our blank canvas with one metric field element ready to begin our creative Endeavor but before we start playing with the elements let's check the main panel options where you can quickly modify the title description transparency and other settings Well for now let's name our panel my first canvas panel great now let's move on to discuss the data that we will need the canvas panel can display all sorts of data for this demo we will use the test data data source to illustrate how to integrate data with our canvas elements for more information on the test data data source Link in the corner now the canvas visualization has lots of data Freedom the only thing I recommend is to provide data sets with a single row or to be mindful that with multiple rows of data the panel will pull by default the last row let's add some data to show you this situation the data that we will use is provided in a CSV format in the video description now let's change the test data data source to CSV content and we will add the multi row column set now double clicking on the metric element and selecting a field it displays the last one again be mindful that by default everything in the canvas will pull the last row of data so why don't we use now the single row data set and now that we have it we can go over all the crazy things that you can do with the canvas panel canvas panels are super special and different from other panels because with them you can interact a lot with the elements inside as you saw earlier you can click and double click on some elements you can right click on them you can drag them select and resize them and if you hover over them you will see little crosses that will let you pull arrows out of them ah and you can also Al right click on an empty space where you will be able to add elements or set the background so well why don't we do that right click on the background and click on set background here you can pick images that grafana comes with like this one it doesn't look awesome but uh we will fix it in a moment you can also choose the URL section to provide any image you like which can also be an animated image let's put a URL to this quiet ocean animated image that I like a lot and will make it easier while we navigate through the settings the ca settings are just a few toggles the first one is inline editing you can activate and deactivate the awesome Mouse controls I showed you earlier this is important to have it turned off if you don't want your users to play with the panel as anyone could still move things around but you won't be able to use Mouse movements even in edit mode so let's turn it on while we are editing in this tutorial the next struggle is the experimental element types like buttons wind turbines and other crazy things that we will see in a few but if it is turned off they won't be available so why don't we keep them on last like in Google maps you can enable pen and zoom with mouse controls detailed here below if it is enabled as well you can turn on infinite panning if you may get too many elements inside just be careful as again all this is experimental and because of that I won't go crazy so let's turn that one off and move on now inside of the layer before we check all the layer section let's check the options at the bottom background and Border background is similar to what we saw in the popup window setting in the background image if we remove the image we can set a fixed color or pull a color from the data next we have the image options that I showed you earlier but here you can also pull it from a data field but let's pick a fixed one these pipes and below is where you will be able to modify the image appearance to be original contained cover all fill all or tile it I like fill o and why don't we return to my calm water lastly there is a border option for the visualization straightforward you can set the wi and the radius of the rounded Corners if you have a border you can choose a fixed or fielded color let's keep no borders and let's move to the actual elements probably what you've been looking for this whole time now there are two ways to add elements to the panel right clicking as we saw earlier or clicking add item on The Element Section in this section you can delete duplicate or rename elements clicking on the name or on the pages or on the trash icons you can also rearrange them if one needs to be in front of the other last whenever you select an element either from the panel or of the option section a new section will appear below with specific settings to the element type selected now in this section every element has the same layout section to align the elements vertically and horizontally you can also set border constraints prise reposition and rotate and well you can also change all that with the mouse another common option to all elements are data Links at the bottom for more information on them Link in the corner but now that we cleared up all the elements and their common settings let's move on to the main ones now there's a set of basic shape elements we have the ellipse we have the rectangle triangle a cloud and a parallelogram they are useful for when you want to create flow diagrams all of them have a text setting with a fixed text option or a data field and you can set fixed text colors or from a field you can do vertical and horizontal alignment and change the size and below the layout again common to all elements we have the background of the shape where you can set a fixed color or from a field or an image and Below you can modify the bord width change the color and the roundness if it's a rectangle now let's move on to another common element type the metric element allows you to display real time data values it may look like a rectangle but the behavior can change based on the values double clicking brings a field drop down whose values change colors based on the thresholds for more on the thresholds Link in the corner in the metric settings we have the text section again fixed and filled options beware if you set it as filled here the color won't change with the thresholds as when you did it with a double click now below you can also change the color the alignment inside of the box and the size and under that we have all the standard stuff that we talked earlier now moving on to the text type it is similar to the metric but when you double click it you can set a fixed text and it has a transparent background now in the settings you can change the text settings the layout background color and Border well as usual just beware again the background color is transparent by default the next element is the icon which lets you add an SVG icon image that you can colorize clicking on the fixed SVG path the icon options allows us to choose folders and even URLs where you can link to an SVG image but in the unicons folder you can choose from a vast variety or select from a field well let's select uh the cented icon now Below in the settings you can choose a fixed color or from a field and under these ones well again the standard settings the next element is the server it is useful to represent data centers or specific servers in your visualization and the first setting is the type of server which can be a single server a stack one database or a terminal then there's an option for a status color now switching through the different server types you may notice that they have tiny circles representing in lights or bulbs and a cool thing is that we can colorize those and not only that you can also make them blink well let's check this configure the rate in Herz either fixed or from a field well I like one Hertz one per second cool it is really pretty right like a Christmas tree now let's move on to the experimental elements that we talked about in the canvas options they are the button and a few crazy others like the wind turbines and the drones but first the buttons they can trigger and interact externally from the canvas panel on their settings we can change the variant from primary secondary success and destructive if you ask me there I just change of colors but next we have the standard text things inside of the botton similar like Source text color alignment and size but below is the interesting part clicking a button can call apis so to do so we can Define the endpoint the type of call from get post or push and with get we can set query and header parameters but if we select post or push we can also set the content type being Json text JavaScript HTML XML or URL encoded and then we can add any needed payload this is super powerful as your panel now can be interactive now now onto the quir key elements we have turbines and drones with the turbines you can configure the speed of the plates in revolutions per minute RPMs if we check the drones we have three types or Tri views H the top the front and the side with the top view you can set the speed of each one of the four rotors and also configure its pitch but with the front and side views of the Drone you can only control the pitch since the rotors look weird from the side right now moving on to another important element are connectors they are not in the plus sign or right click that we saw to add a connector hover over an unselected element to see little X's around it hovering over those X's you can drag an arrow from it and pull it to another element to leave it floating that creates a connector now connected elements can be moved and they will stay connected cool right now selecting a collector also brings useful settings you will see little dots that appear uh where you can twist the connectors let's make this one s shaped now selected on the panel settings we can change the color the size of the line and the arrow and the radius which Smooths the twists all of those can also come from from data fields you can also control the arrow to appear forward reverse both ways or to have no arrows then you can change the line style to be dasht dot not only complete not only full but the coolest thing if you have the dash or doted the lines you can also animate them so many things that you can add and do with the canvas panel right okay let's uh save it and add it to your dashboard to create all sorts of crazy things seriously the canvas is the first of many steps and crazy ideas that you may have to learn about some of those check the videos on the screen and with that you're now ready to create stunning interactive dashboards that go beyond traditional visualizations happy dashboarding and have a good one
