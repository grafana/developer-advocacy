Ruben actually won last year. That's right, isn’t it, Ruben? Yes! Unbelievable dashboard, and I'm really excited to hear you talk about it, so take it away.

Hi, my name is Ruben Fernandez. I'm passionate about space and have always dreamed of being an astronaut. That is the main reason for creating the dashboard. It was for me to enjoy doing it because it relates to something I really love.

One of the reasons I love my dashboard is that it includes a video showing something real, which you can compare with the panels I built around it. You’re getting the same information: Where is the station right now? What is passing by? Is it day or night? You can see all that in real-time video streaming. Having all the packets together really keeps people engaged, allowing them to watch the dashboard for hours.

At the beginning, it was only the tracking part for my dashboard, but then I thought about the astronauts. It's not just the station moving around; there are people inside working there, risking their lives. With my own dreams of being an astronaut, I decided to add that part. There is a widget that allows you to input your city and country, telling you exactly when the station will next pass by. 

It makes me feel like I’m right there. Even though it may sound silly, it feels like I’m watching the area from up there. When I see the areas the station is passing over, I try to recognize them—“Oh wow, this is this island, or this is that country.” And it’s true; that’s what the panel is telling you.

So, amazing job, Ruben, and congratulations on winning the third annual Golden Grot Award! It means a lot, really. Even though it’s the second one, winning the award means that people voted for your dashboard. It indicates that what I'm doing is something that users like and that the community and Grafana appreciate.

For me, space has always been a dream, and giving me the feeling that I'm on the station is amazing.
