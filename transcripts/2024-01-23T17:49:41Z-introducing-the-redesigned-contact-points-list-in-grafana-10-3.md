Transcript: Hey everyone. Here's what's new
for Contact Points in Grafana 10.3. So, the first thing you'll notice
is a visual overhaul of the page. We now have two tabs at the
top for Contact Points and Notification Templates. We also have a new search feature for
finding Contact Points that you're looking for based on either a name or a type of receiver that a Contact Point includes. We're also making it easier to inspect
your configuration by showing you which Contact Points are not being used or
helping you find all of the notification policies that are linked to
a specific Contact Point. There are also several smaller
improvements such as service icons, making it easier to see
delivery errors, for example. We have short descriptions for Contact
Points that help you find the Contact Point that you are looking for, and we've improved the integration
with Grafana On-Call as well, bringing you straight to that
Grafana On-Call integration. We have a lot more planned for Grafana
Alerting going forward, so stay tuned.
