Transcript: Hi, my name is Adela and I'm an engineer
on the DataViz Squad at Grafana Labs. Today I'm excited to announce
some updates to Canvas. First, we've worked on Tooltips. As a continuation of our
efforts to standardize
tooltips across visualizations, we've updated the Canvas Tooltips
to be supported by all elements tied to data. Besides the
element name and data, the tooltips now also
display the timestamp. This is a step forward from the previous
implementation where Tooltips were shown only if data links were configured. Another exciting update
is about data links. Now, data links in Canvas no longer
need to be added using overrides. Each element configuration has a data
link section where you can easily add or remove them. A new addition to
data links is the one-click option, which allows user to open
data links with one click. In order to enable that click links and
the first data link in the list will become the one click. It can be easily switched by dragging
and dropping another link into that first position. Disabling the one-click
option will re-enable the tool tip, and all data links can
be accessed from there. The drag and drop feature has
been added for all visualizations. We appreciate any feedback you
may have, and stay tuned for more. Thanks from the DataViz
Squad at Grafana Labs.
