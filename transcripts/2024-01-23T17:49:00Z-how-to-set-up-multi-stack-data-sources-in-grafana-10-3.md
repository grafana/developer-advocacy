Transcript: [Music] in this video I'm going to walk you through the creation of an access policy and a data source that's capable of creating metrics from multiple Stacks in this organization we have three different Stacks team engineering team team finance and team leadership um I want to have a data source in team leadership that is capable of fetching uh metrics from both team engineering and team Finance I'll start by creating an access policy with the name leadership that is able to access both team engineering and team Finance it has the ability to read metrics I'll then create a token and save the token in my clipboard I'm then going to hop onto the team leadership stack and create a Prometheus data source prus I'm going to switch back to my team engineering it could be either one of these two so I'm switching back to the team engineering stack instance details clicking details under Prometheus and grabbing the C end point for it and then I'm selecting basic off under authentication and under user I'm going to need the IDS of both the Prometheus instance under team engineering as well as the same for the team Finance stack so I'm going to grab this ID right here paste that in and then I'm going to use a pipe separator and grab the ID for the team Finance stack paste that in and then I'm going to paste in my token I now have a data source named per that is capable of fetching metrics from both stack team finance and team engineering so I'm going to demonstrate curing a specific metric switching to the promethus data source and then I have already preconfigured both Stacks with a a synthetic monitoring check and let's take a look you see there's a couple of metrics here I'm going to select probe success and then use that and then you there you go you can see that I have a couple of metrics called probe success and they have a tened ID label for each one of the the promethus instances I have in my stacks
