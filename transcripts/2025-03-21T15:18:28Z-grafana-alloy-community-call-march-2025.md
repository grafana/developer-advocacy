Transcript: nice uh Sam do you want to host or should I host or as you want sorry I was distracted with a a Slack thread feel free to wrap something up here a second cool but I don't have much so first off uh does anyone have a topic to discuss else I can I I do have something to show else uh if there's nothing um but first of all I wanted to ask actually um was anyone impacted about uh the deadlock um bug that we had uh recently um in 1.7 pulling the the rework of uh our Loki source file so it was it was patched on 1.7.4 before but was curious if someone was was impacted here um because it was actually following a rework of this this component and now we would like to bring it back in in 1.8 but uh this time without the the deadlocks so if some people are here are using the the component and would be willing to to try an experimental version to to test that scale that that would be that would be super helpful but yeah if you want you can contact me directly on on the community slack and I will I'll share um a docker image for you um else I can show uh a new upcoming feature um which should should well which is planned for for the next release um let me set up my screen cool so I don't know if some of you are familiar with our Alo UI but we have a new version of the graph coming so if I click on on the graph here this is the new graph um and the thing is that you can see the data passing through so here for example I have my hotel receiver and I can see that there are around 38 um traces per second passing from there to the attribute processor and 80 like matrix per second passing and I can follow it around so for example here you can see after the batch is it's a bit different because the some of them are are waiting in the batch and being sent afterward um it it does not support yet all components it will support the the scrape component um and it will also support modules so for example here it's like a I have a module i can click on it and click on the graph and now I see what's happening uh inside of my module [Music] um right here because they're relable so it works only for components that have uh support for live debugging um and one thing you can do is that uh if I go back to the graph here one thing you can do is that you can change the window so here the data is refreshed uh every 5 seconds but I can put it to like 20 if I want uh and then it will be refreshed uh every 20 seconds um I think that that's it actually so hope I hope you like the this new graph um in the follow following um release planning probably to add live debugging to more components trying to have like a full coverage so you can really follow the data all over the like through all components uh and probably at some point at um support for pipelines that are imported via fleet management um I think that's all I have for this feature any any questions all right then I'll stop sharing cool um anything else we want to to talk about any question from the community or any any topic from from the alloy team to share any questions maybe oh yeah I have a question uh did did anyone ever try um the hotel like the converter that we have in alloy that converts an hotel config into an alloy config i think it's it's a bit hidden in in the documentation but we have this so basically for users that are using um an alloy an hotel collector they can actually just take their config and like replace um their hotel collector by by alloy and apply the conversion and run it then normally this should be like a smooth drop in replacement there are right now some limitations but we're working on on it um this quarter to to make it as as smooth as possible but I think we we need to find a way also to advertise it a little bit so probably in the alloy.com or in graphana uh to make it more visible you can also run a Prometheus configuration and a prompt configuration and an agent static mode configuration which I hope very few people are doing at this point but I also don't know of many real case uh use case like out in the wild any use cases where people are using these things all right um then if there are no more topics no more questions uh maybe we can just uh end early for the uh is anyone here still using agent and for people who watch this on YouTube the reminder might be that agent uh goes away in November PSA it's a good reminder Matt should uh definitely include that in each of these um because anyone who's looking to migrate from agent to alloy might need support and it'll be easier to find that uh if we provide it for you ahead of that uh November deadline because I figure there will be quite a few folks pushing it last minute yeah if you have any questions or concerns about this uh please reach out in the community Slack and we'd be happy to help all right then let's let's stop here i'll stop the recording
