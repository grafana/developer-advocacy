Transcript: Hey, welcome to Grafana for Beginners. I'm Lisa 
Jung and I'm a developer advocate at Grafana. In   the previous episode, we talked about how to set 
up and run the self-managed editions of Grafana.   Today, we'll go over how to create a Grafana cloud 
account. Grafana is available as software as a   service. If you would rather focus on observing 
your system and not worry about installing,   maintaining, and scaling Grafana on top of that, 
Grafana Cloud would be the way to go. There's no   credit card required to get started. You get a 
free trial to the pro tier for 14 days. After   that, you'll still have access to the free, 
open-source Grafana functionality on Grafana   Cloud. Everything we'll cover in the series 
can be accomplished with the free tier and it   should give you plenty of resources to explore 
what Grafana can do. So let's create a Grafana   cloud account. When you go to this link, it'll 
take you to the Grafana cloud homepage. The   same link is also included in the description. 
When you click on the Create the Account button,   it will prompt you to choose your sign-in method. 
You could either choose a single sign-on option   so you don't have to remember any credentials or 
you can sign up using your email and password. If   you decide to sign up with your email, you have 
to verify your email address as a last step. You   should get an activation code in your inbox so all 
you have to do is to enter the code here in the   box shown and the site will take care of the rest. 
Next, you'll decide on a unique name, the URL for   your Grafana instance. You can go directly to 
your Grafana environment by pasting the URL into   your browser. Then you could choose the region 
closest to you. Then click on the Finish setup   button. You'll be taken to the resource page 
that helps you to get started with Grafana.   That's literally all you need to do to create a 
Grafana cloud account. The next step is to connect   the data sources to Grafana so you can start 
visualizing your data. Now there are countless   data sources that you could connect to Grafana. 
This series will mainly focus on Loki, Mimir,   and Tempo. Throughout the series, we'll connect 
these data sources to Grafana to visualize logs,   metrics, and traces. If you want to access more 
episodes of the Grafana for Beginners series, go   to the Grafana community web page. This is where 
all the community resources are shared. You can   access the series by clicking on the Grafana for 
Beginners card. I also want to introduce you to   the Dashboard card. This page contains resources 
regarding how to use dashboards to visualize your   data. When you scroll down on the page, it 
allows you to search for dashboards that the   Grafana community has created. You could filter 
by category, panel, data source, and collector   types and gain inspiration from how the community 
members with various technologies and data sources   are using Grafana to visualize their data. You 
can also upload and share your dashboards with the   community as well. All right that's a wrap. Thank 
you for watching and I'll see you in the next episode.
