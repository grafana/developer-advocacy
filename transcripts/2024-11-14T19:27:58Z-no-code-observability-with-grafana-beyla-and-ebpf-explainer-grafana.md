Transcript: I feel like at this point we can all agree that easily getting set up and observing your applications is a constant struggle nowadays you most likely have your apps built in go C C++ python Java JavaScript Ruby and everything in between but chances are you've dealt with the pain of having to add agents make sure dependency versions actually work and also needing to redeploy everything just to get basic observability I can confirm it's not very fun so that means we're looking for a tool that auto instruments our apps for us is lightweight and also gives us insightful data on our apps and services well good news for us the team over at grafana has been working on a project and released it back in 2023 called Baya now the whole ethos of the Baya project is for people and customers to get up and running with app observability by leveraging a pretty cool technology called ebpf the tldr here is that Baya inspects and identifies your applications running on Linux Baya then activates a number of ebpf probes to capture data about the traffic being received and sending out of your applications Baya then converts this data to open Telemetry formatted metrics and traces to be sent off to a backend like grafana but zooming back out Baya gives you Red metrics or request error and duration to be able to essentially model how every service across your infrastructure is behaving so as mentioned these red metrics do come in the open Telemetry and Prometheus format meaning it is truly vendor a notic however it does pair really well with graphic Cloud's features such as app observability and looks really slick but let's quickly review number one baa Auto instruments your apps without any code changes needed as long as it's running on Linux number two baa is powered by ebpf and can be used to observe apps networking and process resource utilization number three baaya is open source and pulls red metrics in the format of Optometry and Prem meeus now in the next video I will show you how easy it is to get up and running with baaya but in the meantime if you want to check out more documentation please visit the link above or in the description below I hope you learned something new today and as always drop a like subscribe or even comment below on what you want to see next take care everyone
