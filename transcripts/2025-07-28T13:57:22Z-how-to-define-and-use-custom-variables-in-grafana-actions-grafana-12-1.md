## Summary

In this video, Adela, an engineer from the DataViz squad at Grafana Labs, introduces a new feature that allows users to define and utilize custom variables within visualization actions in Grafana 11.6. She explains that actions enable users to trigger unauthenticated API requests and now, with custom variables, these actions can become more dynamic and interactive. Users will be prompted to enter values for the variables when the action is triggered, enhancing real-time customization without needing to alter the dashboard configuration. Adela highlights practical applications, such as setting a thermostat or creating a support ticket, showcasing the feature's utility.

Hi, my name is Adela, and I'm an engineer on the DataViz squad at Grafana Labs. Today, I'm excited to share that you can now define and use custom variables within visualization actions.

**Quick recap:** Actions allow you to trigger unauthenticated API requests, and they became generally available in Grafana 11.6. With this new feature, you can define custom variables and use them directly in your request. 

When the action is triggered, you'll be prompted to enter values for those variables. This makes actions more dynamic and interactive, allowing you to tailor requests in real time without having to modify the dashboard configuration. 

This feature is especially useful when actions require input from the user at the time they're triggered. For example, you can set a thermostat to a specific temperature or enter a problem description when creating a support ticket.

Thanks from the DataViz squad at Grafana!
