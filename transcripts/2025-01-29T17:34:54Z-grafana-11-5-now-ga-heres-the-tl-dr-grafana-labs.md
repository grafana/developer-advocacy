Transcript: It's Grafana release time! Grafana 11.5 is out with
some exciting updates. There are a few main themes this time:
Sharing visualizations, managing data, and migrating between local and cloud.
Let's take a look at what we've got. There's been a ton of work on improving
sharing dashboards and panels. First up, the entire workflow for this
has been streamlined. Now, when you want to export
your dashboard in any way, you start with this export menu to make
a copy or backup of your dashboard, you can export the JSON that
Grafana uses internally. If you want to publish this for
other people to use in their Grafana environments, you can select that
as an option. On the other hand, if you want to send a snapshot of
the dashboard, you can export a PDF, some options for how this gets formatted
are available. Once it's finished, you can save it and share it with
your colleagues. Speaking of PDFs, Grafana's reporting features got some
love in this release. To configure these, go to the reporting settings page. You can set the theme that Grafana
uses for PDF reports and add your own branding and links. What about
sending links to panels directly? Now, when you share a link to a panel, you have the option of creating a
sample image from the current dashboard. Like reporting, you can change the theme before copying
the image and the link to send along. Let's talk about data. A big change in 11.5 is
how ad-hoc filters work. Previously, you had to do a lot of hunting through
dropdown menus to build one out. We've streamlined this process and now
it takes fewer clicks to create powerful filters on your data.
Speaking of managing data, the extract fields transformation
got a powerful upgrade this release. Now when you have messy data with
multiple values crammed into one field, you can use a regular expression to
extract the data in the format that you want. Finally, for those of you who are tired of running
Grafana locally and want to move to the cloud, there's good news. The Grafana Cloud migration tool
now supports all plugins and Grafana alerting as a public preview. This will let you move your entire local
Grafana configuration to the cloud with just a few clicks. As always,
this is just a sample. There are way more updates in 11.5. Check out the What's New page on
grafana.com for more information, linked in the video description.
So go grab 11.5 and stay observant.
