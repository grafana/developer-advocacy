Transcript: hello I'm Matt Rya principal engineer at grafana labs and I'm excited to tell you today about explore logs check this out explore logs is our new experience for analyzing logs aimed at helping developers very quickly troubleshoot and identify issues at a glance you'll see spikes and dips in your log data and in properties throughout the logs extracted automatically while explor is great for power users who want to unleash the full potential of log ql explore logs helps new to Loki new to grafana users get insights from logs immediately without having to learn a query language to get started with explore logs in grafana Cloud navigate to the hamburger menu open explore choose logs I'm doing this on play. g.org so you can follow along if you like I'm going to use the explore logs data source here and you can see then it presents me with my services volumes are broken out by log level and I get preview of the logs themselves this allows me to immediately see any spikes or any anomalies even at this level by clicking and dragging on a region in the graph I can actually zoom in as well so I can focus down even at this point when I'm ready to select a service I just click select and I'm going to choose the mimir ingestor service here if you don't find the service you're looking for uh you can just search for it here so immediately I see more detailed log volumes here at the top and I see the actual log data down below but notice we have these additional tabs here labels fields and patterns and this is where things get really exciting let's look at labels first labels represent indexed fields in lowkey examples are cluster namespace you might have application in here it depends on your case so you immediately get a visualization of each label including all the values within them so again at this point you'd be able to spot if anything's going ay and you notice there's like a little Spike here that might be interesting selecting a label drills down into that label and now we see all the values Broken Out imagine if there's an issue here you would see this immediately maybe I'm interested in this one what can I do now I can include or exclude log lines from this cluster so this is all without writing any queries I'm just going to include here now I'm only seeing logs from that cluster that is so easy right so Fields next Fields is very similar except this is the metadata that's extracted from the log lines themselves so this is very nice this is just extracted automatically uh you know I haven't had to go and do any configuration to make this work fields are represented in the same way you get the same histogram you can click to drill in and then you see the values and you can go from here if you have a view with lots of graphs you can use the sort by dropdown to choose how you'd like to order them the idea here is we're going to help you find interesting things on this page patterns are very interesting patterns are automatically mined from the log stream so again you don't configure these they group log lines up by similarity and let you deal with that entire set of log line at the same time so for example in here you can see 30% of our logs follow this kind of pattern maybe this is as you can see it's a debug statement it might be noisy I might want to exclude that from the logs when I go back logs that line is now gone similarly I can also include them to narrow down perhaps I know that it's a completing block message is is where it's related to the issue so if I include that and I go to logs I only get completing block log lines and I can just look at them all as as one and figure out anomalies from there so this is all about narrowing down find the right things very quickly and get rid of all the noise so you can focus once you've narrowed down you can then look at logs through the classic log view seeing the log lines or you can use the table view so for example I might say ah let's pull out this user ID column here into its own column and order by that now I'm looking at activity all from this particular user and that's so easy to do that just by a few clicks so we're as you can tell we're really excited about this new experience we want you to try it we want you to use it on your real data and we want you to get in touch there's a give feedback thing at the top here that you can click that gives you a form please get in touch please use it let us know and thank you very much
