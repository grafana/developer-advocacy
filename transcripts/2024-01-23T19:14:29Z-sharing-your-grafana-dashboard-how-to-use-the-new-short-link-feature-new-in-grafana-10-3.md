Transcript: My name is Diego, and I am a Product
Designer in the Explore Team at Grafana. And today I just want to chat about a
quick update that we've added to our sharing options. So traditionally we've always had
this one-click convenience that allows you to share the shortened
version of your URL. You know how sharing your
data with others is crucial, and it can be quite frustrating when
time ranges shift due to relative time settings. So we want to ensure that
when you share a snapshot of your data, everything remains as you're viewing it, regardless of when someone else opens it. And this brings us to our new options
that's available on this little chevron or dropdown. So
when you click on here, you'll see a couple of more options.
These are the more familiar ones, the normal shortened
URL for tinier URL than your normal url. And then this is the new
absolute time range intact, which is fantastic as you'll be able to
share this link and others will be able to see the exact data you are
looking at when they click on it. The other cool thing is that when you, if this is a normal part of your workflow, so if you click on absolute shortened URL, you'll notice that for your convenience
we've retained the one click, but this time it will be
on whatever you used last. So as you continue to build
up your query and share links, that will remain there. Of
course, if you wanna switch back, you're more than welcome to
switch to a previous version. So hopefully this creates a lot more
of convenience in your workflow. Thank you.
