Transcript: Hi, my name is Nathan Marrs and I'm the Tech
Lead of the DataViz Squad at Grafana Labs. Today, I'm excited to announce you can now
plot Enum data in time series and state timeline visualizations. This feature is useful when you want to
visualize the state of a system such as a status of a resource or the
health of a device. For example, you can visualize the status of
resource as on, standby, or off. To display Enum values you can use the
Convert Field transformation and convert the desired field to the Enum field type. You can customize how Enums are rendered
by using the Enum Transformation Editor. You can rearrange
values, remove values, and add custom values and more. You can visualize Enum data not
only in time series visualizations, but also in state timeline visualizations. Here we can see the status
field displaying the state
of the resource over time alongside other metric data. We appreciate any feedback you
might have on this feature. Thanks from the DataViz Squad at Grafana.
