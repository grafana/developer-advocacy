Transcript: hello gra Fanatics have you been in the situation when you have lots of metrics that change over time and you wish that there was an easy way to see their variations over time then the time series panel visualization is what you're looking for and in this video we will do a deep dive so that you know what a Time series panel is how to create it how to use it and how to customize it to create the most beautiful and shiny Time series time series visualizations are the bread and butter of grafana visualizations they are the default and primary way to visualize time serious data so why don't get on to create our first time serious panel first we will add the first time serious panel to do so we need to access or create the dashboard inside of which we will create the panel inside the dashboard you can always add a new panel with the Upper Plus ad button and by selecting visualization after pressing the button you will be asked to select a data source to pull the data into the table panel for this example we will use a data source everyone has in their grafana instance the test data data source for more information about it check the link in the corner now let's click on the test data data source to select it and after that you will get to a screen with with lots of options below and on the side of this graph space this is the panel editor screen by default grafana selects the time series visualization style so we have it already selected let's select something below why don't we start with something simple let's choose the random walk and later we can go over crazier ones but now that we are talking about multiple data and the query panel let me quickly show you this if you want to show more than one time series at once you can add a second query let's select the conditional error nice we have two in one in the same way you can add as many queries as you need to have multiple times Series in the same graph or a single query can give you multiple series to but right now to keep things uh understandable let's keep it at only two series for now I will for now turn off the random walk so that we see only one because we're going to start making things look a bit different again we are in the panel editor now in the right section of the panel editor the panel display options have several elements but the first thing for the time series which is the same thing with almost all the panels is the panal title the description the links and repeat options these are the general panel settings for now we will just modify the title let's put the time serious panel video now get getting inside of the time series options the first element is a tool tip this is the little box that appears while you hover over the data points in the graph by default the Box displays the value of that individual point but the next option will show you all the values under the vertical section where the mouse is over and to help you identify which measurement is for which series each one is prefixed by the query name or the field name and lastly you can remove having any tool tips but I like having them all okay next we have the legend which is the bottom line of the panel indicating you which series is which not so difficult telling the series apart when you have only one series or two series but if we go to the exponential hit map wow now we need help for sure to know which one is which so for that first we can remove it turning off visibility since we have so many series uh let's keep it next we can change the mode to make it a regular list which looks horizontal or we can turn it into a vertical table m not so pretty with a table as we have so many series and uh it has to scroll underneath right but the following options makes it easier we can have it at the bottom or at the right of the graph much better right being on the right if we change the list or table does not change much else than the table lines but I think that the table is pretty I like those lines oh beware if we have the placement on the right we will get the option to modify the width I want to make it a bit thick for a moment because I'm going to show you the last element in the values section we can couple the series names with specific values like the last one the minimum and Etc you can add many values and if you do too many you will have to scroll moving on we have the axis on it the first thing that we can modify is the xaxis or the time axis and for the first setting you know time zones can be kind of a headache if your data source may come from all over the world here you can select to convert uh the x-axis to many time zones and select which one to display as you can see you can choose so many but personally I like the time from the users's browser or the UTC let's keep the browser okay but if let's say you miss the UTC we could add one more or two or more but nah just the browser okay next we have placement this effects where the Y AIS measurements are placed by default or Auto they are on the left you can put it on the right or have nothing in the y-axis and you may wonder what is then the difference between Auto and left well with auto everything is left except when you have a series with some other measurement scale let's uh show this we're going to change to Rand walk table where you can have both with one extra one on the right okay but let's keep what we had before now that we I showed you what we had since we have only two which are the same I like the left traditional positive quadrants now next we have the label for the y axis let's add it as that Y axis label and it will appear as soon as we type it the next one is we have the width for that label we just wrote grafana by default calculates and assigns a width but I think it decided it a bit spacious so let's put a 20 better right now show grid lines we have another dat that is uh on auto by default and here Auto means that it is on but can change if there is too much data density we don't want the lines of top of lots of points as well we can permanently turn it on or permanently turn it off I like it always on okay now we have the yaxis color affecting the text of the y axis w a mouthful we can switch between the theme text color or the serious color and I like colors so serious it is under it is a show border option which activates or deactivates the display of the border line and I kind of like to keep that line moving on we can play a bit with the scale as the data that we may want to play Maybe negative logarithmic or change from linear to log making it hard to see it with a the simple linear for that we can change from linear the default to logarithmic or Sim log which means symetrical logarithmic okay for linear data we can turn on to be zero to be in the center again this is useful in case we have negative values but if we select logarithmic we must choose the log base to be two or 10 look at that 10 it looks pretty right okay but in the symmetric logarithmic where you have both both linear and log you can also set the linear threshold where it will change from linear to logarithmic but uh let's keep it linear as we're not playing with crazy numbers last we have a soft mean and Max by default they are empty and they pull the defaults from the Max and minimum from the series values but this can be bad if allum values variate too little from the range that you want to see the data as an example your retirement savings account may vary just a bit month by month but uh you may want to see how far are you from zero or how far are you from a goal instead of uh just seeing the variations from up to down in that case you may want the soft me at zero and or the max at your retirement goal but we don't have any lifetime goals here so we will leave it as it is now collapsing the last section we will be moving on to another fun section the graph Styles here is where we will be able to define the look of our time series graph as we can modify it from lines the one that we have seen so far but we can also check bars with Will paint sticks on each metric and points which well paint points now depending on which of these you select different configurations and things that we can customize will appear so let's start with the simplest one the points selecting points the only thing that you can customize on them are the point size meaning how many pixels each point would be to make them very visible let's scroll them up to the maximum which is 40 but oh wow it is too big okay let's do 10 perfectly visible now that we saw the only setting for points let's move on to the next style the bars style as you can see once you selected the graph will change from points to Sticks per measurement I like this one for when we do have not too many readings or not too many serieses as well as it can get chaotic look at this right but do what switch you to best if you like that view go for it but for now let's go back to only one series to show you the settings to show you some of the bar settings I will jump first here below and activate points yeah this pretty much fuses both Styles points on top of bars cool right here with auto graan decides if painting or not points you can decide to turn it off and we can turn them permanently on so let's keep them on same as with just the points you can change the size and stack series now we have some pretty bars all right moving on to the main style the one that we started with and the one with most options the lines style as you can see the points were kept active from what I selected on the bars but you can activate and deactivate them the same way I want to keep them to show you the next options here the line interpolation is how the line will behave between data points we can make it linear meaning a straight line line from point to point creating angles with the next line to the next data point or we can smooth them and Cur them between data points last we can make them step before or step after it looks a bit like bars but it means that the line only changes at a data point and stays there until the next one or vice versa for the step after I kind of like them smooth look how pretty now the next option is the line width I think it's also self-explanatory like with the bars you can push it up to 10 but uh let's stay at three now following up we have an interesting situation uh what if we receive a new value in our series well let me add one to show you now by default grafana will disconnect the lines and give you an empty space there or here we can tell grafana to always connect the values or connect and show a gap if there are nles for larger periods of time than the treas that we Define I like to know when we get emptiness so never it is now last is the option to disc connect values this is not so related to NS but only where there is no report on values for a bit of time well let's not connect that then and well I think that was it all now you are the time serious Master the rest of the options are part of the general panel editor options and for more information on those General options Link in the corner now let's say that you want settings to apply to only one series or that you want the same graph as series to be lines and another to be bars and the third one to be points what we have been modifying affected all the series that we had on screen so let's use overwrites to personalize each so let's click on overwrites at the bottom or as well if we switch to the overwrites tab at the bottom is the same the overwrites gives us multiple options to select the series that we will overwrite but I like the name one if you want more information on overwrite rules Link in the corner using the name selector I will pick the one that has a few points now we add an override property and since what I want to change is a style we select it from graphs Styles now let's select bars let's also change the line style as I want it to be different and there you go now we have a line Style coexisting with a bar style in the same panel and in that same way you can modify more settings in the single time series or you you can even change settings to be unique per each Series in your graph by adding an override for each series wow so many things right well finally I think that is all now you know all the crazy fun things that you can change and set on your time series graph now go ahead and create your own time series visualization panels in your own dashboards and stay tuned for the next grafana video happy dashboarding and have a good one
