Transcript: so hello everyone who is watching our monthly Community call uh here uh where together with uh developers of Uncle are going to the latest updates and uh answer questions if they will be any if you're watching us on YouTube and want to join the next Community call go and check the link below the video in the description uh it's an open Event so everyone is able to join ask questions propose something and talk to the engineers who are working on that um call uh together today we will show two things uh first uh Vadim will show update updated version of direct paging it works much better now and it we fixed uh use case when you are a member of water work and you want to invite some team so white version will take uh talk about a little bit about this and uh later I will rare uh the latest really latest update who made an uncle usually feelings go uh which increased the speed of loading the plugin uh I will just oh sneak peek how fast it's working now so with him go ahead thank you hello my name is Vadim I'm a software engineer here at the final apps working on the grafana call today I'm going to share a bit of the update that we did on the direct patient feature it's basically a feature to page people manually um we already had it in place but recently we introduced some changes I'll just go ahead and quickly show a quick demo so here we have our grafana uncle basically um if you want to page someone manually you can use this button in your alert group you just click it and now we have basically three or four fields that we need to fill in uh previously that was uh a bit more you could uh make that pretty granular but it wasn't solving the use case when you want to really like bring someone from a team and I believe this use case should be solved by the latest update and the whole direct paging feature experience should be much more streamlined now and it should be it should work much better and in slack too so yeah I'll just show how it works just click demo so as a title we'll just uh select some something simple help me please my printer is on fire just regular stuff and the the biggest change here in this feature is that now direct paging Integrations are linked to teams and teams can configure their escalation chains and their chatops channels so basically here I have this test team is just a demo team that I want to share and here you can see that the final call automatically selected the right direct page in integration for the steam it will tell you which chatops channel it uses so you will see this this alert that I'm going to create in random in slack so that's that's good and you also can jump to this integration and just check out different settings where it will be posted which is collection chain it uses and stuff like that so let me uh so yeah that's the the first use case when you just want you have a problem and you want to solve it bringing someone from a team so you just select the team you fill in the team and message then just click create Tada so basically you have created an alert group and it will be assigned to this test team escalation chain because it was selected in this integration so basically every team is free to configure their escalation chains as they want and they still will get a page in their respective chatops channels and escalation chains um just a like few words about teams you can configure teams at the at the grafana level so it's not only bound to the to the plugin to the uncle plugin but it's a team is a concept of like Minecraft on a product and so basically you just can create a new team let's make another one I just show you I just show you how you can set up a team and set up a direct page integration for this so we created a team at your users for this case only I'm in this team then go to on call on call will actually automatically sync your teams when you create it so let's let's see our Integrations Maybe yeah it's my local setup so things might get broken so yeah uh basically if we try to create a new alert group for this team let's just try it out demo team you will get a warning this is because it's a new team you don't have direct page integration for that for that team and basically it will tell you that you can uh set up an integration for for this team also it will link you to the docs I will talk about talk about it a little bit later so um to create the direct paging theme you can either go here and just go ahead like uh not not looking at any warnings you just can create the the alert group and you will create a direct page and configuration automatically so and there's uh just you can create new integration just search for Direct paging it's a type of integration so I'll just call it demo direct paging and you can assign it to a team for example demo team in this case so we create the integration we can set up some escalation chains slack channels and stuff like that so in this one I'll just leave it empty and post it to slack channel for example be it General so yeah I'll go ahead and create a new log group help me demo team help needed and here you can just select the damage him it will be you will be told which chat UPS channels it will be posted to so for example in this case General you'll get a warning because this particular direct page in configuration doesn't have a escalation chain configured but that's okay and in this case let's also page someone additional so you can actually go ahead and pick your users or schedules so in this case I'll just ping test schedule my user my on-call user is actually one call for this schedule so I'll just go ahead and notify that too and yeah we can just go ahead and create an alert group and you will see that it's it's assigned to this demo direct pageant integration that we created earlier and also we have an additional responder on call this is because I have this user as on-call user for this test schedule that we pinned so yeah that's that's pretty much it I think it should make things much more easier to to for solving this like basic use case when you want to bring someone from a team so yeah this feature is also available in slack you can just type slash escalate and it will prompt you with like exactly the same Fields Title message team to notify the same warnings will be generated the same additional responders can be added and yeah the the feature part here became much much more much better and yeah that's pretty much it also a few words about the documentation we updated docs for this part of the product about direct paging it should it should be much more clear now on how to use it on how to add responders for existing alert groups for example uh what to do with warnings how to set up a direct paging for a team and just like a basic use case on how to use it um yeah I'll share this link in the chat and that's pretty much it thank you if you have any questions thank you so let's go to the next feature it's eclipse so let's go to the next feature next feature uh will be next update will be matched by everyone eight years who ever used a phone call uh and I will share [Music] how it was before and how it will be in the future so this is my personal stack and uh let's remind ourselves how fast does it work so if I go outside the phone call plugin and go back we see this initializing plugin message which sometimes takes a while sometimes it's fast but it was pretty much unavoidable and in some environments it worked really slow and I'm going to show the version which is not yet introduction but we'll pretty soon be there and unfortunately engineer who built it ildar is not here in the call so I have to present it for himself instead of him so this is how it works now if I go outside of Uncle and going back it takes a few milliseconds oh it's super fast uh hope you like it and that's it about updates we are ready to show thanks everyone have a good evening morning see you next month bye
