Transcript: I just watched the Graphfano keynote and here's what I learned. Graphano 12 comes with new dashboard themes, a tabs layout, support for SQL expressions, and version APIs and schemas. This is a dashboards as code approach that lets you sync your dashboards with git. There's also a new graphana cuddle CLI tool that lets you manage dashboards from the command line. On the hotel front, we've donated Graphfana Baila to open telemetry, improved Graphana alloy, and contributed to some language SDKs. If you like dashboards that don't require queries, traces drill down and profiles drill down are now generally available. There's also a new investigations feature that allows you to bring in panels from different drill down apps and add comments. But the thing that I'm most excited about is the new LLMbased Graphana assistant that can answer questions, summarize data from dashboards, provide best practices, and even create dashboards from a chat Nintendo.
