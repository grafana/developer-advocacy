Transcript: hello Graphics managing complex network infrastructures with multiple nodes can be chaotic especially as your network grows knowing where and how each element connects is vital but it can be hard without a visual image enter the node graph panel visualization in grafana your solution to the complex puzzles of networked [Music] elements graph's not graph panel VIs ization is a powerful tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into your Network's topology health and performance while allowing you to drill down into each element with this you can also visualize any directed graph like organizational charts molecules and even mind maps but no graphs have particular data requirements that we should check before we create our first node graph panel [Music] not graph panels represent a set of elements and the relationships among them and those are precisely the not graph panel requires first a list of the elements called notes and then a list with a relationship among them called edges for the node list we will require a unique identifier for each element and in the relationships list we will identify who connects with whom now basic structure aside you can add a few more data items in both of your lists to maximize your node panel powers for the node list you can add a title and subtitle to be displayed two stats maintenance soft the color of the circle the full color icons and much more and for the edges you can define a couple of stats Main and sof context menu details thickness and highlights if you want some examples of these you can find some csvs in the video description and beware because the column names must mat match the specification for more information on this link in the corner and now that you understand the data needs why don't we create our first node graph panel we will use grafana play to create our first nde graph panel the steps will work as well in a local grafana setup to access grafana Play Link in the corner grafana place home screen is a dashboard and there you can click on the add button on top and select visualization to add a panel in the panel editor set the panel as node graph at the top right corner to quickly get a visualization we will use a test data data source and select the node graph super easy we got our first visualization if we view it as a table this returns two lists with the two elements mentioned notes and edges now that we have our first note graph panel let's generate another one from scratch and customize the element ments in them all right changing the test data to CSV we will copy and paste the first CSV notes in the that are in the video description which shows data icons first we will create a query and name it notes and then we are going to paste the CSV in it write away some elements but they are not connected well that's because we need the edges so we will add a second query name it edges and paste the edges CSV awesome notes connected now if we switch to the table view you can tell that the notes have an ID per element title subtitles stats detail view colors radius a highlight option and an icon if you want to know what icons can be displayed check the link in the corner and the same goes for the edges we have an hiid who connects with whom stats messages highlights and thickness most of the graph panel customizations in terms of visualization come from the data here in the panel settings you can only Define the units of the stats metrics in the notes and in the edges ah and as well this is one of the few panels that have no field overwrites and you also cannot move the noes manually again everything comes from the data and grafana handles it to play a bit further let's copy and paste another data set from the CSV data in the video description uh the display changes when bringing the data values instead of the icons if you want check the CSV values to understand the different elements that you can modify with all the examples in the description when you click apply it will show your node graph panel quering a data source that provides the required node graph data helps to visualize lots of information and you can also place them together with many other panels out there if you want to learn more check the videos on the screen but now you have side be on site with your new not graph panel happy dashboarding and have a good one
