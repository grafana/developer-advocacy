Transcript: this is Adam LTZ in this video I'll provide a quick overview of asserts for graphic Cloud one of the biggest challenges facing teams today is dealing with the complexity of their observability data and that's where asserts comes in by providing a layer of Intelligence on top of that data to help you understand the behavior of your applications in your services we're able to do this by automatically correlating related issues when a problem happens this allows you to cut through the noise and get a root cause faster so let's start by exploring how asserts is able to automatically correlate issues by scanning the labels of your metrics asserts automatically discovers application and infrastructure components and builds a graph based on their relationships in this example asserts has built an entity graph for this robot shop application that includes all of its components asserts is running rules in the background to discover your golden signals and we can see that the shipping service is having a problem with latency based on this red ring around its circle using this entity graph asserts understands all the components associated with the latency in the shipping service and automatically correlates them into one single view the RCA workbench so let's go ahead and take a look at what's happening now with all the issues in one place asserts makes it easy to cut through the noise to focus on what's important we can see the assertions being recorded There's a garbage collection happening with the jbm there's an error rate Spike we're seeing a latency anomaly as well as a version update switching to the summary view gives us insights into the timeline of when things happen as well as how the services are connected taking a closer look we can see that the shipping service started to have garbage collection then the error rate started to spike and we started to see some latency this all happened after a deployment scrolling down we can see that my SQL is also affected with a major spike and buffer pool requests as well as CPU usage now we're starting to get an idea of what's happening so let's take a closer look at the garbage collection asserts makes it easy to quickly jump into specific graphon dashboards by providing them out of the box so you don't have to go looking for it we also want to take a look at the corresponding logs and traces ass sear is able to highlight the relevant logs by service name and we're seeing a slope query here in the system and we can also quickly access the relevant traces to see what's happening with the latency in the shipping service so there you have it assert adds a layer of Intelligence on top of your observability data to help you restore Services faster thanks for watching
