## Summary

In this video, Ivan Merrill, a product owner of observability at Aaho delays (also known as Albert Hine), shares insights from his extensive experience in monitoring and observability since 2006. He emphasizes the importance of not assuming adoption of monitoring tools, such as Grafana, simply by implementing them. Ivan discusses the challenges of engaging developers and fostering a culture of adoption, highlighting that human issues often lead to project failures rather than technical ones. He advocates for a collaborative approach, building trust with early adopters, creating a "happy path" for adoption, and providing comprehensive documentation to ease the onboarding process. The key takeaway is that successful observability is not just about technology but also about understanding and addressing human factors and fostering a supportive community within the organization.

# Observability and Adoption: A Talk by Ivan Merrill

My name is Ivan Merrill, and I am the product owner of observability at Aaho Delays, also known as Albert Hine and Etos Kalenhal. We deliver about 40% of the nation's food supply. 

I have a long background in monitoring and observability, having started in 2006 with Microsoft Operations Manager, now called System Operations Manager. I've worked with various tools, including IBM Netcool, Zabbix, and Tivoli. One of my significant implementations was HSBC's internet banking platform in 2008, utilizing auto instrumentation and tracing. With this extensive experience, I hope to share valuable insights on a crucial subject: **Don't Assume Adoption.**

We are all here because we recognize the value of monitoring and observability; it helps us solve many problems in the software development lifecycle. However, many people do not fully understand or embrace its benefits. When I started, I naively believed that if we built it, they would come. That notion is a lie. Simply building a tool does not guarantee adoption, even if it is as appealing as a well-designed Grafana dashboard.

Recently, I was on a call with the front-end team, gathering feedback on our tools. They admitted, "We don’t really use it. We just installed it because it was a task on our backlog." They had checked the box for adopting Grafana, but now it is my responsibility to inspire them to engage actively with it. 

### The Human Element

The main takeaway from this talk is that **humans are complex.** In almost every project failure, the root cause is rarely technical; it is typically human issues that lead to setbacks. We need to understand the challenges people face in adopting tools like monitoring and observability. 

Often, the assumption is that if we can automate everything, the problem is solved. For instance, at Capital One, we deployed tools that automatically provided observability. However, when teams received alerts without understanding their origins, they often took little action. It is crucial to engage with people rather than enforcing adoption through automation alone.

### Creating Compelling Choices

At our organization, we approach infrastructure monitoring by emphasizing the importance of alerting teams when something goes wrong. We make it compelling for them to choose to adopt these tools. By collaborating with audit compliance teams, we can demonstrate how adopting our solutions can save time and effort.

We need to foster a culture where people feel confident in the tools they use. For example, I learned early in my career that instead of highlighting failures, I should focus on celebrating successes. When I approached a talented developer, he was resistant to the idea of monitoring because he believed his code was perfect. Instead of pointing out potential failures, I shifted the conversation to demonstrate how monitoring could showcase the excellence of his work.

### Building Trust and Community

When I joined our current organization 18 months ago, I recognized that I could not single-handedly roll out observability to over 500 engineers. Therefore, I focused on building relationships with early adopters—those intrinsically motivated to embrace new tools. 

We need to create a community where these early adopters feel comfortable sharing their experiences and insights. Trust is vital in this process; it is hard to gain but easy to lose. By working closely with our early adopters, we can establish a strong foundation for wider adoption.

Additionally, we need to create a **“happy path”** for adoption. This means making the process of integrating new tools as straightforward and beneficial as possible. If the path to adoption is fraught with obstacles, people will seek alternative solutions or avoid the tools altogether.

### The Importance of Documentation

Documentation is another critical aspect of successful adoption. It is essential to provide comprehensive and accessible resources to support users. Good documentation reduces the need for repetitive answers and fosters a culture of self-service. It helps alleviate the fear surrounding new technology and makes it less intimidating.

We must also treat questions—no matter how simple—with respect. If users feel safe asking questions and see that their concerns are addressed in documentation, they will be more inclined to engage with our tools.

### Remembering Our Customers

Ultimately, we must never forget that our users are our customers. Engaging with them and treating them with respect is paramount. We need to create support channels that are responsive and helpful, rather than directing them to forums or discussions where they may feel neglected. 

In conclusion, while we have excellent technology at our disposal, the real challenge lies in human engagement. Just because we have the tools does not mean we have solved the problem. It requires effort, understanding, and a commitment to fostering a supportive environment.

Thank you very much for your attention!

## Raw YouTube Transcript

My name is Ivan Merrill. I am product owner of observability amongst other things in Aaho delays. You know that as Albert Hine, etos kalenhal in the um thing. We deliver about 40% of the country's feed or food or feed 40% of the nation whatever that works out at. Um so that's what I do now. I have a long background in doing this. I started working in monitoring and observability in 2006 with Microsoft operations manager that's now called system operations manager. I've worked with every tool thingy about that that IBM net call. Yep. Done that. Zabix, Tivoli, all of that stuff. Um many big implementations was implementing HSBC's internet banking platform in 2008 with auto instrumentation and tracing and stuff but a long time of doing this. So hopefully that means I'm qualified to talk to you about my um chosen subject. Um and my chosen subject is this essentially don't assume adoption right um we are all here because um we know about the value of monitoring right and observability and it's all great and we know that it helps us solve everything and earlier in the software development life cycle all that good stuff we're sold on it many people are not and when I naively started I thought build it and they will come All right, that's a lie. Building it will not result in adoption even if people know about things even if you've got a great graphana thing and it looks wonderful. We had a really recent example here. So, I was on a call with uh VA getting some feedback for the front end thing and they asked, "How do you use this stuff?" And our front-end developers very helpfully replied, "Oh, we don't really use it. We just installed it because there was a like a task on our backlog, right?" Okay, cool. Well done. You got a tick in the box. You adopted Graphana. So, now it is my job to go and inspire them, right? And that is essentially what I'm doing. And that is part of my role. So um the point of this talk is to say humans are difficult right and in actual fact there's a great book I can never remember the name people wear human wear whatever it's called um pretty much every project that fails if you break down to it and say was this human or technical there's very little projects that we start across all of humanity that we look at and say yeah technically we can't do that just doesn't really happen in tech right it is almost always human failure is human issues, human problems um that cause uh a project to fail. All right? So hopefully we can all agree with that and accept that. So what are the challenges and obstacles we face particularly in our chosen domain of um monitoring and observability and how can we help people understand that whilst we know the many benefits that they're going to get them as well, right? How can we bring humans along with us? Because there are many reasons, many valid reasons why humans aren't adopting things quite often, right? We need to engage humans. Because the first thing you might think is, well, this is an easy problem to solve technically, right? Automate all the things. Yeah, someone builds something, they deploy it automatically, they get observability, it is there. Nothing for them to do. Wonderful. Solved problem. Technical. Um I did this at a company or some of my peers did this at uh Capital One. Brilliant idea. You deploy something, you get all of this um stuff. But the point is that when they get an alert, if they had no idea what was generating that alert, what the metrics are, they don't really know where that alert is coming from, what are they going to do about it? Probably very little. Um until someone tells them their system actually is broken and they need to go and investigate it and anything else like that, right? So we could enforce things, right? But experience for me tells that's a bad choice, right? We actually need to engage humans. We want them to opt in to something. We want them to cross the line to say I choose to do this humans engaging their brain. A wonderful example for us and how we're doing things at our hold is we have infrastructure monitoring. We say, you know, we can't monitor your application or tell you what when your application is going to be broken, but if all your pods are down, you're going to be having a bad time, right? That we know. So, we can generate an alert for you that and we can use Mir recording rules and we can make it super easy for you to adopt, but you have to choose it, right? We will actually make this really compelling choice to you. We will work with the audit compliance control teams to say if you adopt that look at all of this amount of compliance work we save you. It's a very compelling story. It's stupid not to but you have to choose to. All right. We are making the human cross the line. That is very important. Um have I missed a slide? No I haven't. Um so uh right that was earlier than I thought. Um, don't call the baby ugly. Yeah. So, I used to um have uh this team that I worked with um these very kind of essentially I was a bit scared of them. These very intense developers, right? They were brilliant though, right? And I was quite young in my career and I went out to them and told them monitoring is brilliant. It tells you when your stuff is broken. You're going to have some incidents and stuff and we can help you resolve them. The guy very curtly replied to me, "My code is great. Why are you telling me my code is going to break? Why don't you tell me that your monitoring shows me how excellent my code is? Bloody hell, that's a great idea. Why am I trying to sell you on your failure when I should be telling you that I'm helping you sing your successes? This is a simple thing, right? Four nines. That's an incredibly hard thing to achieve. Be proud of that. Sell that. I help you sell that. For POS, right? always a much more difficult conversation than the engineers. I help show the great work that your team has done. We sell your success. This is a simple psychological thing, a human change, twist in the story, but it is a big way to encourage adoption because I'm no longer selling failure, I'm selling success. People like success, right? Graphana is an amazing tool for visualization. If you have a Richard George who can great dashboards like he does, do that and show them to people and say, "Look, this is success. This is what it looks like. Isn't this won't your management be really pleased on this?" Great. That is a way of selling it, but that is a human way of selling it that does not involve technology, right? And you know, pictures paint a thousand words and SLO and Grafana is great at that. SLOs's is my go-to, by the way, if you ever want to do this and tell people. It's a really good way to say we sell your success when you are starting out in an organization. So I joined our hold 18 months ago, right? It is clear to me that I am not going to personally be able to respon be responsible for rolling out to a thousand something across 500 engineers and whatever it is with the scale, right? That's too much for me, right? I need others. And I have a team. We're great. Yeah, we call ourselves cerebro because we use X-Men characters at our hold for whatever reason. So we uh need to make friends, right? We cannot do this all alone and we need to find people who are intrinsically motivated to do things, right? Generally, they kind of kind of come out to you. You recognize them as the people that maybe are a bit battle scarred, have been in incidents with no data. Can you all hear that crackle by the way? Is that okay? Sorry. Is that me moving? Okay, I'll try and stand still but that's very difficult for me. Um, you need to make friends in an organization, right? You need to make friends. You cannot go alone. Generally, they will come to you and say they are intrinsically interested. These are your people. Do not lose them. Yeah. Culture like that friendship, right? Identify these people and you know work with them. They are your friends and allies. Yeah. And you need to build that relationship, right? Because what they're going to do is they're going to make really great early adopters, right? I hope we all settle on the idea that we don't just release something to the whole organization and say everyone go wild, right? We have a bunch of early adopters. Yeah. These are your early adopters, your friends. Yeah. Engage with them. Foster that relationship because ultimately when it comes to a wider relation roll out, we need trust. Right? And trust is something that is really hard to gain but so easy to lose. And again, it's very human. Work with your early adopters. The people that came to you, they are intrinsically motivated. They want to find solutions. Yeah. You don't have to tell them to prioritize stuff on their backlo. They'll do it. You make friends with them. You use them as early adopters. You get that feedback. You sit on incidents with them. You do everything you can to earn their trust to get their buy in early on. You will be rewarded times a thousand later on, right? Because then you have not just the fact that you've overcome technical challenges, on boarding, automate, all that all that stuff, but like you actually have human uh what advocates, allies in your organization, right? So build trust, bring this community together, get them working together. It's all so important, right? Trust is a precious commodity. Um it was mentioned earlier, I think in the TomTom talk, and I completely agree with it, right? Build a happy path. We already discussed earlier that uh some standardization stuff is good up to a point. I have my infrastructure monitoring. I make my teams adopt it, but I make it easy for them to do so. Right? And and we want to do that, right? We want to make it easy for them to do the right thing. We don't mandate. We don't say you have to do this or we will definitely give this or it doesn't matter whether you like it or not, you've got it right. We say happy path. Come join us on our happy path. It's really easy. Look at all the stuff you get for free. We want you to do it. It should be a stupidly obvious decision to come join me on my happy path. If it isn't right, if there is friction, I need to go out and work out what that friction is. Meet you there and let's resolve it. All right, this is what we need to do. This is an exhausting continual task, right? But you need to do it. Provide a happy experience. Yeah, when I first did this talk, it was a slightly changed thing and I called it developers are creative problem solvers. don't look like a problem or they'll solve you, right? But that is that is what comes in here. If your happy path looks like a problem, they'll spin up their own instance. You won't know about it, right? They'll do something else. They'll solve you. Your happy path needs to look simple so that they know to do it. Um, also I did kind of mention it, but the happy path is not static. as your technology evolves, as new things go out, as your backend team starts looking at Cotlin as well as Java and all that stuff, go with them. Um, documentation is important. It's important in terms of my internal documentation. It's important on the external documentation. This is one of the actual points, but I can talk about Graphana. There is no other tool out there that has an ecosystem in the same way that a Kfana house does, right? My god, use it. While I've been here, someone's been talking to me and said, "Should we write documentation about how to interact with the Grafana API?" I'm like, "No, Grafana's done that. Let's not repeat that." Point them there. But, however, for everything that is our flavor of things that we do, we document, right? With our observability team, we had documentation before we'd released the product. We had on boarding guides. We knew everything. It is so important. It is everything that you do. With one of my previous teams, I joked to them about documentation week. They laughed until I actually gave them documentation week and everyone worked on nothing but documentation and they were so happy and they hated me. Um, but it was important, right? We'd reached a point where our products had evolved and our documentation no longer reflected reality and that created this thing that impacted our trust which we know is so important and we need it and we protect it. So we go back and we update our documentation, right? Documentation, documentation, documentation, documentation. It is so important. But also another thing, right? From our point of view, this is how we scale. Yeah. I'm not answering the same question to all 1500 engineers. I'm writing it once in confluence and sending everyone that link, right? This is how we scale. If you answered that question 10 times, you should have documented it. It's a form of form of automation. But also start referring people to um that documentation. Don't answer the question. Point to the documentation. generate that self-service culture where people start looking in your docs first. Otherwise, you won't scale. It's also, by the way, just how you look a lot less scary. If we come back to one of these human factors, right? New technology is scary for people. And if they don't know Graphana or PromQL or anything else like that, that's off-putting to them. They will not engage with you because you look scary. Give them some documents. You look less scary. Woohoo. provide safety. This is hard and it takes a long time, right? But we always have dedicated commun um communication channels for questions and everything else like that. But treat people with respect. They are humans. It might be yes, a stupid question, but right, let's go with it. If it is a stupid question, why don't we put it in our documentation and never answer it again? Right? Let's meet them there. They're humans. Okay? We have to provide safety because we do want people to overcome their fear of engaging with us and on boarding with our technology because otherwise they won't on board and we want them to on board right ultimately we need them to need us right in a kind of weird way right if our engineers don't need the services that we provide then I'm sure out of luck right so I need them to need us and I do that by engaging with them and I provide them safety we provide community channels we really respect them we answer these things we engage them. It's hard but you know it takes time but it will get there. If you keep working and investing on your relationship with your peer, your customers, your peers, whatever you want to call them, right? You get this wonderful point where you get people over here asking a question which responded to by people over here in the organization. Nothing to do with our team, right? And the team over here is saying, "Oh, by the way, that's in the documents. Here's the link. Brilliant." Right? All of those people are not to do with our team. It is not by luck that we've been in three organizations now and all three teams have had it. It's because we we've been intentful on that, right? We've respected these people as humans. We've really worked hard to engage with them. We've made them feel safe to ask those questions. They do it. We've created this lovely community. Okay. Worthwhile. because ultimately there is kind of one thing that I want everyone to remember and I'm a bit quicker than I thought I was actually. Um they are your customers. Yeah. Never ever forget this. When I first joined this team in our whole first thing pretty much changed. I was like it's like I'm not even going to get into like the technology and what we're doing and everything else like that. Right. The first thing is we have a support channel but we have no one answering it. What is going on people? They are our customers. Yeah. They are the point that we get paid. Like if you want to take it like really that way, right? Why aren't we engaging with them? Yeah. And there are ways of engaging. At one point people were like, why don't we just have GitHub discussions? And my always thing is like if I run, you know, like Digo or KPN, yeah, I'm not trying to offend anyone. And I don't know who customers are here, but anyway, if I run one of those companies and asked for customer support because my broadband isn't working and they sent me to a forum, I would be annoyed, right? If I got sent to a live chat, I'd be less annoyed, but still annoyed. If I got a person, then I'm just annoyed that my broadband is working right, but I feel treated right. This is how we like should be within our organizations. They are our customers. We need them. So hopefully throughout this talk you've understood that the some we have a great technology, we have a great tool. Grafana have done a really good job of providing you with an enticing tool that really makes it possible for observability to be a wonderful thing in your organization. But just because you've bought it, it is not the problem solved. Now you actually face a difficult challenge. And the difficult thing in it is humans. So with that, thank you very much.
