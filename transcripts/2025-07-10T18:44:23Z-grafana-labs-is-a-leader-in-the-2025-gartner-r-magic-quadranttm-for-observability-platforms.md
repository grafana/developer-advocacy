## Summary

In this video, Tom from Grafana announces that the company has been recognized as a leader for the second consecutive year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for observability, notably achieving the furthest position in completeness of vision. He highlights four key areas that Gartner emphasized: their adaptive telemetry approach that optimizes costs, their leadership in open source and involvement in the Prometheus community, enhancements in insights and productivity from telemetry data through tools like drill down apps and automatic root cause analysis technology, and the introduction of an AI assistant that aids users in utilizing observability data effectively. Tom expresses pride in the recognition and excitement for future innovations aimed at creating a flexible, cost-effective, and continuously evolving observability platform.

# Grafana Announcement

Hey everyone, Tom from Grafana here. 

Today, I'm proud to announce that we've been recognized for the second year in a row as a leader in the **Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability**. This year, I am incredibly proud to be the furthest to the right in terms of completeness of vision on the MQ. I think this is a testament to the work our teams have been doing, innovating in our product, and building the most complete observability platform out there.

Gartner highlighted four key aspects of Grafana Cloud that they believe are visionary:

1. **Adaptive Telemetry**: We have taken a unique approach to help our customers appreciate the value they get from their telemetry. By optimizing costs and eliminating unnecessary data, we allow organizations to grow and scale without worrying about excessive observability costs.

2. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Our leadership in open source, particularly our deep involvement in the OpenTelemetry and Prometheus communities, has made us very flexible and adaptable. In our recent observability survey, we found that 71% of organizations are using Prometheus and OpenTelemetry in some capacity. We are investing heavily in OpenTelemetry this past year, with one of the co-founders, Ted Young, joining us recently.

3. **Enhanced Insights and Productivity**: We have focused on enhancing the insights and productivity that users get from their telemetry data. This includes features like our drill-down apps, which make it easier for users to query their metrics, logs, traces, and profiles. Additionally, our asserts, knowledge graph, and automatic root cause analysis (RCA) technology help accelerate the root cause analysis process.

4. **AI Assistant**: Gartner, and I, got quite excited about the AI assistant that we launched at Grafana. This feature is now rolling out to our customers, and we believe it demonstrates tangible ways to extract value from large language models (LLMs) and observability data. We are thrilled to see both beginners and seasoned users find joy and productivity enhancements while working with the assistant to analyze instances, fix dashboards, and build new dashboards.

Being recognized by Gartner as a leader year-over-year is truly rewarding for the efforts we have put in. We are committed to working with our customers, innovating in this market, and staying fresh. 

We're just getting started! We have so many more exciting developments coming out in the next year, as we build the future of observability—one that is open, flexible, cost-effective, and driven by continuous innovation.

Thank you!

Hey everyone, Tom from Grafana here. Uh, today I'm proud to announce we've been recognized for the second year in a row as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for observability.

I think it's a testament to the work our teams have been doing, innovating kind of in our product and and really building, you know, the most the most complete observability platform out there. Gartner really highlighted uh kind of four things about I think about Graphfana cloud that they um they think are so so kind of visionary, right? One is is the approach we've taken to helping our customers appreciate the value they get from their their telemetry through adaptive telemetry. You know, really optimizing your costs, getting rid of things you don't need, you don't use, and allowing you to, you know, grow and scale without having to worry about excessive uh observability costs. I think the second big area that they've highlighted is how we are like so flexible and adaptable with our you know our leadership in open source in particular deep involvement in open telemetry the Prometheus community and our open source projects around Graphana Nimir Loki Tempo and so on you know we found you know 71% of organizations are using Prometheus and open telemetry in some capacity in our recent observability survey and uh you know we're investing heavily in open telemetry this past year with uh one of the co-founders Ted Young joining us uh recently. Two other areas that that kind of Gartner highlighted you know with our completeness of vision here is is how we've focused on enhancing you know the the insights and productivity you get out of your telemetry data. So this is things like our drill down apps making it much easier for users to to query their their metrics, logs, traces and profiles or things like our asserts, knowledge graph and automatic RCA technology really helping accelerate root cause analysis. And yeah, fourth thing, final thing is I think Gartner and myself got got really quite excited about the AI assistant that we launched at Grafana. Um, and that's like now going rolling out to our customers. And we think this really kind of shows, you know, real useful tangible ways of of getting value out of LLMs and observability data. And we're just excited to see both beginners and seasoned users, you know, find a lot of joy and and productivity enhancements like working with the assistant to root cause analyze instance or or or fix dashboards and uh you know, build dashboards and so on. So yeah, being recognized by Gartner as a leader year-over-year like is really I think such a like a such a reward for the efforts we've been putting in, you know, for working with our customers, for trying to innovate in this market and and really, you know, uh stay fresh. We're just getting started, right? We've got so many more things coming out in the next year. Uh building the future of observability, right? One that's open, flexible, cost-effective, and driven by uh continuous innovation. So, thank you.
