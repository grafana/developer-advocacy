Transcript: synthetic monitoring is one of the easiest ways to begin implementing observability it provides insights into the health of your system helping to enhance the reliability of your services hi I'm Bola developer Advocate at grafana in this video I'll show you how to perform a ping check using grafana Cloud synthetic monitoring grafana Cloud synthetic monitoring is a blackbox monitoring solution that allows you to monitor services and applications by running checks from public or private probes located globally this allows you to assess the availability performance and correctness of these services and applications with ease with synthetic mon users can perform a wide variety of checks from browser checks ping checks DNS checks and TCP checks along with a wide variety of other checks in this video we'll focus specifically on PING checks and walk you through how to set up your first ping check with graphon synthetic monitoring a ping check is a very simple way to verify that an endpoint is reachable it can be used quick to diagnose network issues and ensure consistent connectivity for critical systems it works by sending icmp Echo requests to a server and if the server responds you know it's available icmp Echo requests or icmp pings are specifically designed to check if a device is reachable on a network even if it doesn't host any HTTP Services graphon Cloud synthetic monitoring makes it easy to run pink checks from different locations all over the globe then provides you with valuable insights into to the latency how long it takes to get a response from the server and availability of your services for multiple regions let's walk through how to do a ping check start first by creating a graan cloud account and visiting the graan cloud homepage for your instance go to the left navigation column under testing in synthetics choose synthetics this is where you'll be able to learn and try out synthetic products click create a check and as you see we have a lot of options for checks once we choose a check type we will choose endpoint API and this is where you'll be able to set up a ping check step two choose a job name you will be naming this job my app semicolon ping we recommend to choose a job name with the service name and the request type to stay organized request type ping choose a request Target we will be choosing graana.com for this example but request targets can be any URLs from your deployed applications make sure to save this request after clicking save we are brought to execution here you can decide which Pro to send the request from we will choose sa South Korea you can also set a private probe but we will stick to a public probe for this example next you can select frequency make sure to keep in mind the free tier limits for using this service and there you have it you created your first ping check on the Ping check we named my app semicolon ping notice you can see seconds frequency of the Ping the number of pings that occurred one location which is so South Korea which we chose how many ping executions are estimated to occur every month and finally you can click view dashboard and you can navigate to an outof thebox dashboard that shows the uptime reachability average latency there you have it you now know about grafana Cloud synthetic Monitoring Solutions and how to create a ping check you can check out grafana play synthetic monitoring to see a dashboard with a variety of running checks if you want to learn more about graphon Cloud synthetic monitoring make sure to check out this documentation all the links will be down below see you in the next next video [Music]
