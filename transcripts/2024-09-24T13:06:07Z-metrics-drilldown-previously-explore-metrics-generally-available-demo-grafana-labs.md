Transcript: Hello, I'm Mat Ryer from Grafana Labs and I'm
excited to show you a new way to work with your telemetry data. Explore Metrics lets you browse
your data without writing queries; you can easily spot anomalies
and drill in from there. We even show you related metrics so that
you can further your investigation and people are reporting that they're
solving problems now in a fraction of the time, thanks to this new app.
Let's check out Explore Metrics. Explore Metrics proactively
visualizes your metrics, and we make it easy to find
the one you're looking for. We show a breakdown of the labels
associated with this metric, and the graphs mean you can
quickly see where the spikes are. Once you find something interesting, you can add it to the filters and
the whole app focuses in on it. This ability to hide all the noise is
key to getting to a resolution faster. The Related metrics tab finds other
metrics that you'll probably want to look into as well, so that's Explore Metrics. Insights are brought to you proactively
through these beautiful visualizations. You can easily spot problems and
explore related metrics so that you can diagnose issues faster than ever.
The team are busy at work now, adding even more support for OTel and
looking at ways to integrate the apps so that you can easily traverse signals. Check this out and let
us know what you think. Your feedback is also valuable
and will drive our roadmap. Get in touch and thank you
very much for watching. Check out the other Explore app videos
posted alongside this video. Thank you.
