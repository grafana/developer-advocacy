Transcript: Hey there. I'm Drew Slobodnjak from
the DataViz Squad at Grafana. Today, I'm excited to announce Pan and Zoom
in Canvas. This helps support larger, more complex layouts without
sacrificing granularity. To enable Pan and Zoom, head over
to the Canvas Options editor. Here, you can toggle on Pan and Zoom.
Mouse wheel zooms in and out. Middle mouse button or Ctrl
plus right mouse button pans. Double click to reset. Please note: you must first enable the Canvas panel
Pan Zoom feature toggle in your Grafana configuration. We look
forward to your feedback. Thanks from the DataViz Squad at Grafana.
