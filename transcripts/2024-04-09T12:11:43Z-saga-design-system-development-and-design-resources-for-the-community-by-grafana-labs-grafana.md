Transcript: Hey everyone. I'm Staton, a senior product designer at Grafana Labs
and I'm thrilled to introduce the Saga design system. Grafana
has its open source DNA, and we're following along with that
by sharing our development and design resources to our community. Saga is your go-to hub for all things
related to the design and the development of Grafana interfaces and
experiences. And you know, maybe you're looking for
a better understanding of
how we handle accessibility in our components. Or perhaps you're looking for a component
yourself to add to a plugin or maybe you're trying to get a
better understanding of
how Grafana handles forms. It's all conveniently here, empowering
you to create with ease. Now, beyond all of the documentation
that you've just seen, Grafana's Saga Design System
is also the central hub, connecting our designers and developers
to all of our other resources. Maybe you're working in Figma and you
need to create a comp for a plugin. Leverage our Figma community files
and use the latest Saga components to expedite your design process. Are you looking for a way to better
understand the props that come with a component? You can look at our storybook component
library and get a better understanding there. Saga is still very much maturing and
we have many planned enhancements with included content and functionality. So be sure to follow along and reach out
if there's anything else that you would like to see here. Thank you.
