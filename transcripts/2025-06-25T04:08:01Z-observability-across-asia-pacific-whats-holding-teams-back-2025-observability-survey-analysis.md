## Summary

In this video, Anthony Woods, co-founder of Grafana Labs, discusses the findings from the third annual observability survey, which gathered insights from over 1,200 industry practitioners worldwide. Focusing on the Asia-Pacific region, he highlights key concerns such as cost and budget predictability, with organizations fearing escalating expenses. Notably, observability is seen as more critical at lower organizational levels, predominantly led by developers rather than senior executives. Incident response challenges, particularly alert fatigue and a lack of processes, are also emphasized, indicating that the region's observability maturity is lagging behind other areas. Additionally, more than 50% of respondents reported using SaaS solutions for observability, allowing them to leverage open-source innovations without the associated operational overhead. Woods encourages viewers to explore the survey results further on Grafana's website.

# Observability Survey Insights

Hi everyone, my name's Anthony Woods, one of the co-founders from Grafana Labs. I wanted to take some time today to talk to you about our most recent observability survey. 

Our **third annual observability survey** is the largest community-driven survey on the state of observability, with insights from more than **1,200 industry practitioners and leaders** from around the world—individuals involved in or responsible for observability within their organizations. 

Today, I want to discuss some of the **key findings** and insights we've uncovered from our analysis of the collected data. While others from Grafana Labs, such as our CTO, Tom Wilkie, have spoken about some of the findings from a global perspective, I wanted to provide an **Asia-specific view** on the results.

## Key Insights

### 1. Cost Concerns
The first insight is really around **costs**. Like elsewhere in the world, cost is the top concern. Interestingly, we find that within the Asia-Pacific region, **budget predictability** is a close second concern. Companies are not only worried about how much they're spending, but they are also anxious that costs are growing faster than expected and may spiral out of control. 

### 2. Observability Leadership
Another interesting finding is that in the Asia-Pacific region, the **highest level of observability** is considered business-critical within organizations. However, the leadership for observability strategies is much lower down in the organization. Globally, the majority of respondents indicated that VPs and above considered observability to be business-critical, while in the Asia-Pacific region, the data skews more towards **developers**.

### 3. Incident Response Challenges
Regarding **incident response**, while alert fatigue is the largest obstacle to faster incident responses across all regions, a significant cohort in the Asia-Pacific region cited a lack of incident response processes as the second largest obstacle. These insights suggest that the level of **observability maturity** in the Asia-Pacific region is lagging a bit behind the rest of the world.

### 4. Risk Aversion
This is not entirely surprising. With my **20 years of experience** in this region, I've observed that organizations and individual software engineers tend to be more risk-averse, often waiting for technology to be proven before adopting it. 

### 5. SaaS Adoption
The final takeaway from the survey aligns with this hypothesis. In the Asia-Pacific region, more than **50% of respondents** indicated that their observability setup is mostly SaaS or SaaS-only. While we still see high percentages of open-source technology being used, organizations are relying on SaaS vendors to run these solutions for them rather than managing them in-house. This allows organizations to access the innovation and capabilities of open source without the operational overhead of building solutions themselves, helping them to quickly mature their observability practices and catch up with the rest of the world.

## Raw YouTube Transcript

Hi everyone. My name's Anthony Woods, one of
the cofounders from Grafana Labs. I wanted to take some time today
to talk to you about our most recent observability survey. Our third annual observability survey is
the largest community-driven survey on the state of observability, with insights from
more than 1,200 industry practitioners and leaders from around the world — from
people involved in or responsible for observability within their organizations. I just wanna talk today around some
of the key findings and insights that we've been able to uncover from our
analysis of the data that was collected. Now, we've had others from Grafana
Labs such as our CTO, Tom Wilkie speak about some of the findings
from a global perspective. But today I wanted to provide an
Asia-specific view on the results. And so the first insight is
really around costs, right? Like elsewhere in the world,
cost is the top concern. Though interestingly, we find that
within our Asia-Pacific region, budget predictability is a close second concern. So not only are companies worried with how
much they're spending, but they're also worried that the costs are growing faster
than expected and spiraling outta control. One more interesting finding that's
come out is that within Asia-Pacific region: the highest level of
observability is considered business critical in the organization. Or perhaps, and more clearly is that,
at what layer of the organization is the observability strategy being led by — it's
much lower down in the organization. So that's to say globally, we saw
the majority of respondents cite that VPs and above considered
observability to be business critical. While in the Asia-Pacific region, the data
is skewed much more towards developers. The next thing is around
incident response. So while alert fatigue is the largest
obstacle to faster incident responses across all regions, in the Asia-Pacific
region, there was a large cohort that cited a lack of incident response
processes as the second largest obstacle. And these insights altogether here suggest
that the level of observability maturity in the Asia-Pacific region is lagging a
little bit behind the rest of the world. Now this is not really that surprising. Certainly for me, with my 20 years
of experience having worked in this region, it's that organizations and
individual software engineers are slightly more risk-averse, right? Tending to wait for technology
to be proven before adopting it. And this leads to the final
takeaway from the survey, which really aligns with this hypothesis. In the Asia-Pacific region, more
than 50% of respondents cited that their observability setup
is mostly SaaS or SaaS only. So though we still see really high
percentages of open source technology being used, organizations are relying on
SaaS vendors to run these solutions for them rather than running them in-house. This allows these organizations to access
the innovation and capabilities that are made available with open source,
without the operational overhead of having to build solutions themselves. This in turn, is helping
organizations quickly mature their observability practice and catch
up with the rest of the world. Now, check out our survey on grafana.com
where you can find more in-depth analysis, and links to our interactive
dashboard on play.grafana.org, so that you can explore the data yourself
and draw your own conclusions.
