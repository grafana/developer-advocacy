Transcript: grafana plugins are powerful tools that enhance your grafana experience by providing new ways to visualize data connect to various data sources or develop complete applications within grafana hi I'm Tom one of the developer Advocates here at grafana labs and today you'll learn how to get started on your plug-in development journey by scaffolding a plug-in setting up an efficient development environment and exploring the core structure of a plugin within grafana before we get started it's important to note that grafana plug-in development is supported on all three major operating systems this includes Linux Mac OS and windows for Windows users you'll need to install the windows subsystem for Linux to run some of the commands we'll cover in this guide you should also make sure that you have all of the necessary tools installed to build and run your plug-in this includes go Mage node.js and Docker you can find the links to installation guides for each of these in the video description let's get started by scaffolding a new plugin with a single command by using our create plug-in CLI tool we'll do this by running the MPX gcreate plugin at latest command in the terminal you can also use pmpm or yarn if you prefer the commands you'll need to run for those tools is on the screen now once you run this command the CLI tool will prompt you with several questions to Define your plugins configuration first you'll be asked what kind of plug-in you'd like to create there are four options available to you an app plugin allows you to provide outof thebox experiences integrated within grafana this includes custom Pages UI extensions and is also the option to choose if you wish to bundle multiple plugins together a data source plugin allows you to connect grafana to new data sources where they can be queried to produce visualizations inside of dashboards a panel plugin lets you introduce new ways to visualize data or provide widget likee functionality within a grafana dashboard and finally an app with scenes plug-in is a variation of the app plug-in option which comes preconfigured to use the grafana scenes SDK for creating Dynamic dashboards within app pages scenes apps have become the new standard internally when we develop integrated application experiences within grafana but both app and scen apppp plugins are fully supported so feel free to choose which whichever one suits your needs When developing an app plugin if you chose any other plug-in type than panel you'll then be asked whether you would like to add a backend component to your plugin this allows you to support server side functionality such as calling external apis and writing custom backend logic in this example I'll choose to include backend functionality so that we can take a look at how front-end and backend logic are separated within the plug-ins code structure next you'll be asked to specify the plugin's name and and your organization name such as your personal name or your company's name with the plug-in scaffolded it's time to take a look at the anatomy of a grafana plug-in the plug-in folder itself follows the name and Convention of organization name plug-in name plugin type opening up the plug-in folder in an editor like vs code you'll see a number of files and folders that make up our plug-in a lot of the files in the root of the plug-in directory are configuration files required for building running and and testing the plugin these files such as tsconfig Json J.C config.js and playright Doc config.yml one opening up the source directory you'll see a plugin. Json file this file contains all of the metadata that describes your plug-in it contains the information you provided during plug-in creation as well as additional metadata that will become part of your published plugins information in the grafana plugins page as well as on our community plugin site it's important to keep this file up to date with appropriate information such as description images and links to further documentation or contact details this file is also where you'll list any dependencies your plugin has such as the version of grafo that your plugin supports and other plugins if any that your plugin depends on to function the other main file to be aware of within the source directory is the module. TS file while we won't cover this file in detail in this video you should know that this serves as the entry point for your plugins front end code you should also be aware that front- end plugins are written in typescript and front- end components such as panels query editors and configuration pages are typically written using react jumping over to the package folder this is where your plugin backend code lives if you chose to include one the code within this folder is written in go which is the same language that graphon itself is written in the main entry point here is the main.go file as is standard in the go ecosystem again we won't cover the end and outs of what each file does in this video but the main bulk of your plugins back in code will typically reside within the plugin folder here is where your'll write code for things such as your apps plugins backend your backend data source or your plugins resource endpoint let's now take a look at how to build and run your plugin within a grafana development environment via Docker there are a few key steps you'll need to take depending on what kind of plugin you've created from the terminal you should navigate to your plugins directory and run the mpm install command this command ensures that all of the appropriate JavaScript packages that your plug-in depends on are installed once done run the command npm run Dev to build and run the front end in development mode this command will continuously monitor your plugin's front-end code for changes and rebuild them for you when they occur if your plugin includes a backend the next thing you'll need to do is build the backend code using a tool called Mage you can do this by opening a new terminal Tab and running the command Mage hyphen V build colon Linux it's important to be aware that this command will not monitor your backend code for changes so you must rerun this command whenever you make a change to your backend code finally to run the development graph environment you should run the npm Run server command this command will spin up all of the appropriate Docker containers and expose the grafana instance on Port 3000 on your local machine another important thing to note here is that you must rerun this command if you make any changes to your plugins configuration files such as the plugin. Json file I mentioned earlier y gra plug-in project comes configured with a number of useful commands out of the box you can find these listed on the screen now you can always find these in the package.json file in the plugins root directory or from the getting started page in our developer documentation with your grafana plugins development environment up and running head on over to Local Host colon 3000 in your browser to access grafana you'll see that your plugin has been automatically installed and provisioned for you and you'll find your plug-in listed within the administration plugins and data section in the sidebar for data source plugins you'll find your data source has been automatically provisioned under the connections data sources section and for panel plugins you'll see that a demo dashboard that includes your panel has been provisioned under the dashboard section finally for app plugins you'll see that your app is now listed under the app section in the sidebar congratulations on getting your basic grafana plugin up and running this is just the beginning of your journey into the powerful capabilities of the grafana plugins platform to dive deeper and expand your skills visit our developer documentation portal at grafana /d developers there you'll find comprehensive guides and resources that help you develop refine and perfect the plugin you envision but developing your plugin is only part of the journey next you'll need to package sign and publish your plugin to make it available to the grafana community stay tuned for upcoming videos where we'll cover these crucial steps in detail ensuring your plug-in is ready to launch and can be enjoyed by grafana users worldwide don't forget to subscribe and hit the notification Bell so you won't miss out on our future gra for developers tutorials take care and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music]
