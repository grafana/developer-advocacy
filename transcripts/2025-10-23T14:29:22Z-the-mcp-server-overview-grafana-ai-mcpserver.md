## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the transition into the "aentic era" where Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to perform practical tasks beyond just generating text. The focus is on the need for LLMs to integrate with various services and APIs, such as GitHub, Slack, and Grafana, in order to function as effective AI assistants. The speaker emphasizes the challenges of building such integrations, including custom coding, authentication, error management, and code maintenance, which are addressed by a solution referred to as MCP.

00:09:00 Overview of the problem MCP solves  

So, you mentioned the **Aentic Era**, and I really like it. We're entering this phase where LLMs (Large Language Models) need to do real work. It's not just about generating text; it's about performing tasks such as querying primitives, creating incidents in Grafana, or scheduling calls.

We need LLMs to finally integrate with different services and APIs. For example, if you are building an AI assistant, you want it to connect to GitHub, Slack, Grafana, and your internal tools. This integration requires custom code and involves handling authentication, managing errors, and maintaining the code youâ€™ve developed.

This is precisely the problem that MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) aims to solve.

So yeah, you mentioned the aentic era. I I really like it. We're entering this and um in this era like the LLMs need to do real work, right? It's not about uh generate text. It's about uh do things like query primitives, maybe create incidents in graphana or second call schedules. Um we needed them um we needed the we need the LLM to integrate finally with different services and APIs. So let's say that you're building an AI assistant. You want this AI assistant to connect to GitHub, to connect to Slack, to Graphana, your internal tooling, right? Its integration means custom code, authentication handling, you need to do error management, you need to maintain the code that you just made. So this is exactly the problem that MCP solves. Um,
