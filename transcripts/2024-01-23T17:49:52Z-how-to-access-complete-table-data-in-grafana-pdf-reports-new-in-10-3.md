Transcript: Hey, I am Agn√®s and I'm a software engineer
on the Grafana Sharing Team at Grafana Labs. Let's talk about the
Table Data in PDF feature. What problem does this
feature solve? Well, if you are a user of
the reporting feature, you may have noticed that you can see
all data from large table panels in your PDFs. And like in Grafana, you can scroll the PDF table panel
or click on the page numbers. With this new feature, you'll add the option to access all
the data directly from your PDF without losing your dashboard payout. So
how does it work? Let me show you. So here's my dashboard with three
tables. You can see that for all of them, I can scroll in the
table to see more data, but this is a PDF that
is currently generated. I can only see a few lines and
can't scroll in the tables anymore. So let's create a report to see the new options. So now in the format report step, you now have access to two more format
options to embed all your table data either as an appendix to the
main PDF or as a separate PDF. Let's check this option and preview
the PDF to see the real results. And here it is. You can still see your dashboard
content at a glance on the first page, but you can then deep dive into any table
you want to see all data it contains. This feature is in public preview and
it's available behind feature flag, Prior to general availability, we intend to work on the generative tables
in order to make them more responsive to your data and to improve table styles. But we also want to know what you think
of the feature and what improvements you would like to see. Check out the reporting documentation
to learn more and enables the feature to go to try it out for yourself.
