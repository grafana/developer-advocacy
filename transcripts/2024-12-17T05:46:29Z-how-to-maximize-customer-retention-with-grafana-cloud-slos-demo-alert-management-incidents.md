Transcript: hi I'm Mark Cavell a solution engineer here at CFO labs and today I'm going to show you how we can maximize customer retention with grafana Cloud SLO service level objectives help you monitor the customer experience and allow you to prioritize problems that are impacting users these are some of the challenges that we often hear from observability teams employing slos helps resolve these challenges but not every organization is actually using them interestingly enough in our observ ility survey last year about 30% of organizations are adopting slos even though there is about 46% that are planning to implement them in some way often the hurdle for this is like a technology challenge or a cultural challenge graphon Cloud SLO helps overcome both of these and we help overcome these hurdles by providing a framework for creating slos and automatically creating alerts based on the burndown now I'm going to go ahead and show you what this looks like this is an example of an SLO dashboard that's automatically created by grafana for you saving you time and tracking your service Health to Aid an identifying customer impacting issues I can view my SLI my error budget Trend and my error budget burndown rate side by side A View that's showing me of any critical alerts or firing in this example here I can see that my SLI dropped around this time and this would have kicked off a notification to an on call engineer I can track this service across multiple different environments and clusters and see right from the same dashboard that the SLI dropped only in one specific cluster so this has helped saving me time from not having to go to another dashboard so jump starting my in investigation right from receiving the alert about the service level objective breach and creating these is really easy first I'm going to just Define My Success metric and my total metric My Success metric in this case is just less than or equal to 500 milliseconds and not returning a 500 and my total metric is just the total number of requests that are coming into this service as I put these metrics in here I actually I'm getting a preview of what this looked like over the past month I then Define a target for my SLO and I can see at a 75% Target graphon cloud is telling me that I have 100% chance of meeting this objective and if I want to go more aggressive I only have a 51% chance of meeting that objective I'm going to keep it at 75% now and set my team up for success I'll then provide a quick name and description so anybody coming to this dashboard understands what we are monitoring and why it's important and then finally the most important part is defining our SLO alert rules konic a cloud SLO will automatically create a fast burn rate and a slow burn rate alert rule for you the fast burn rate alert rule is going to be an item that you want to page somebody on call and potentially wake them up if this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed the Slow Burn rate alert rule is still an important problem but it can maybe be a ticket from the next day with both cases these are defined in a way to not overburden and produce too much more alert noise and you're only being notified if there's an actual issue impacting the end users over time you may need a holistic view of all of your services in a single place graan Cloud will provide a list of all of your service level objectives so you can clearly see the health of each service next to each other this helps give me direction into which need to be prioritized and to help mtti if multiple are firing at once because grafana is a full observability platform with my SLO monitoring my alert routing and now my investigation can all be done in a single tool allowing me to get to instant resolution faster so we just saw how graphon Cloud SLO enables organizations to adopt slos and maximize customer retention by providing a framework for creating slos and automatically generating burn rate alerts based on those slos burn down Asos adopted graphon Cloud SLO to help maximize their customer retention if you want to learn more about how companies like Asos have changed their alerting state from reactive to proactive please reach out to us thank you
