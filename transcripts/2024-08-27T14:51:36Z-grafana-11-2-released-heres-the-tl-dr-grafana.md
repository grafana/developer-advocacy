Transcript: Hello, and welcome to the latest
Grafana releases, TL;DR. I'm Tom, and in this video I'll be showcasing the
standout features and enhancements in Grafana 11.2. We've packed this update with exciting
new capabilities across dashboards, transformations, alerting, and more. Kicking off with dashboard enhancements, we've supercharged our canvas
visualizations with smarterC standardized tooltips. Now, every data connected element not only
reveals its name and key data points, but also includes a timestamp. This added layer brings a new
dimension of clarity and depth, making your visual insights instantly
more intuitive and informative. We've also enhanced the way data
links work in canvas elements. You'll now find a data link
section for the selected element, allowing you to add data links
without the use of overrides, just as you can with other visualizations. Canvas elements with data links can
also be configured to have one-click functionality, streamlining
the user experience. This update also improves the way
data link ordering works for all visualizations across the board, allowing drag and drop functionality
to control their order. Transformations in Grafana
have leveled up significantly. Now you can inject flexibility into your
data workflows by using variables in a variety of transformations,
including limit, sort by, and filter. This enhancement brings dynamic
capabilities to your dashboard, allowing it to adapt based
on context and user input. We're also excited to introduce a
brand new transpose transformation. This allows you to pivot your data
frames, transforming rows into columns, and vice versa, which opens up much more
versatile visualization possibilities. This fantastic community contributed
feature underscores our commitment to making data manipulation
more robust in Grafana 11.2. In addition to the new
transpose transformation, the group to nested tables and format
string transformations have moved out of beta and are now generally available.
Rounding out the transformation updates, the ad field from calculation transform
has been expanded to include both cumulative and window calculations. This upgrade provides you with
even more control and flexibility, enabling sophisticated data analysis
right within your dashboards. Before we move on, I'm pleased to announce that the state
timeline visualization now supports pagination thanks to an
awesome community contribution. With adjustable page size settings, this feature greatly improves
the visualization's utility, particularly for those
handling dynamic data sources. Now you can navigate through
the data series with ease, ensuring clarity and focus, no matter
the complexity of your data. In alerting, we're excited to introduce the new
centralized alert history page. This innovative feature consolidates
all alert events onto a single, easy-to-navigate page. Now you can effortlessly observe trends
and patterns in your alerts over time. This enhanced visibility improves
your capacity to monitor, track, and respond to incidents
swiftly and effectively. In Grafana 11.2, we've made significant enhancements to
the Explore section to streamline your data analysis. Now it supports log filtering and
pinning - significantly boosting your efficiency when examining
critical data logs. You can filter logs by log level to
quickly isolate relevant information and additionally, the new pinning feature allows you to
anchor important logs to the content outline for easy access during
detailed investigations, ensuring no critical detail is overlooked. Onto data sources now and
for users leveraging AWS, CloudWatch Metric Insights now supports
cross-account observability - ideal for monitoring across multiple
AWS accounts seamlessly. A new account dropdown
has been integrated, enabling you to easily select your
source accounts and automatically build targeted queries. For those
requiring more tailored queries, the Manual Query Editor remains available
allowing you to refine and craft the perfect query to meet
your specific data needs. On the authentication front, we've
improved integration with OAuth providers, enabling you to map organizational
specific roles right from your identity provider. This is a longstanding
feature request from our community, and we're thrilled to have been able to
collaborate with the community to add this feature in Grafana
11.2. As a final bonus, we're incredibly excited to announce that
the Grafana Cloud Migration Assistant is now in public preview. This tool allows you to seamlessly
migrate your existing Grafana OSS or Enterprise instances
over to Grafana Cloud. The tool currently supports
migrating your dashboards, folders, and core data sources, with
plans to include alerting, app plugins and panel plugins in
future updates. And there we have it. These are just a few of the key
highlights from the Grafana 11.2 release. For a more detailed look at
everything we've improved, please take a look at the What's New
page in the Grafana documentation, which covers everything
included in this release, including those that we didn't cover here. Thanks for watching and make sure to
