Transcript: hello everyone and thanks for joining in this video we're going to walk through how graphic Cloud can offer solutions to observability companies struggling with root cause analysis as we talk to observability teams across the globe we see that a lot of customers do struggle with finding root causes and these can happen in three different ways one there's a difficulty in understanding how alerts relate two there's a consistent lack of visibility across application and infrastructure Telemetry data and three there's a lot of toil in creating maintaining dashboards and alerts especially with promql the result of this is increased manual correlation and context that has to be built which results in lagging meantime to detection and prolonged issues with customers and the applications that the customers use graphon cloud has a unique solution to these problems in graphon Cloud you can actually have contextual root cause analysis done for you this is done by ingesting all your metrics and traces into graphon cloud where we will discover the entities and how they're connected identify the golden signals and record assertions based on the data you will then be presented with a troubleshooting workbench that is a single pane of glass across all the different Telemetry signals and this is all done automatically it continually happens as you send the data and it only gets smarter as you continue to use the platform let's do a quick demo as you can see here we're looking at a sample service or application called robot shop you can see all the different sets of databases applications or different gateways that are being used inside of the application and how they're connected to each other you can also see some color coding this color coding represents the health of the service so for example let's look at the shipping service we're seeing a lot of different colors specifically red which means that there are some errors that are happening inside of the shipping service so let's pull out and troubleshoot into our RCA workbench this is where you will have all the context created for you across all the different things that could be happening inside of this application and the applications that are upstream and downstream from this so for the shipping container if we look here we can expand and see that we have four different assertions that are created one is an amend where we can see that a service version was updated then we have an increase in Java metrics garbage collection this then results in both anomalies and errors as it pertains to latency on our application quickly looking at this you can see that there seems to be a cause and effect between the service version being updated and the requisite errors and issues that follow so what if we just decided to roll the version back let's see what that would do and voila now that we've rolled the version back we can actually see that there seemed to be an issue with that specific service version so now proactively we were able to identify those errors roll the service version back and then now go fix that service version in a development environment graphon Cloud provides you all the context that you need for proactive troubleshooting and it also allows you to have clear learning strategy full visibility and it reduces the toil on engineering teams if you'd like to learn more about this visit us at our website at graana.com cont
