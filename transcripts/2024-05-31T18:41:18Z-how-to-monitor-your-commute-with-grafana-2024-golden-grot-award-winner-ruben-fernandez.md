Transcript: I'd like to congratulate Ruben Fernandez and ask him to come up here for his Golden Grot.    Hi, my name is Ruben Fernandez. I live in Atlanta 
Georgia, I've been living in the US for around   25 years now, but I'm originally from Spain. 
I'm married and I have two kids. I work for   Dell Technologies as an SRE. Well it's like a 
year and a half ago, I joined them and I was   going to be a DevOps Engineer but they created a new SRE team and they decided that with my   knowledge I could be a good match for that team, 
so they moved me to that group. So since   last year I've been playing with Grafana. At Dell, we all, 
after the pandemic – the Covid pandemic, we were   working for home. But just at the kind of the same 
time, we receive an email that we have to start   working at the office. In Atlanta, the traffic 
is horrible. It's very bad and then if you   add the weather, if you have a bad day with the 
weather, it's even worse. So traffic could go from   maybe 25 minutes to an hour. It could change...
in that range. In the morning, the first thing we   do, you do like a check in your phone. What do you 
have to do every morning. Okay this, this, this, this...   So I thought, why do I have to check every 
morning, how is the weather, how is the traffic,  how long is going to be my commute? Should I take 
the train? Because it's going to be like 1 hour in   my car. I don't like that. I prefer to go in the 
bus and then the train, I can be reading. So if I   can put it all together in one dashboard, 
and check everything like very quick, and tell me,  'Oh, the traffic is bad. How is the bus? Oh, the bus 
is getting close to me, so I can run." So putting   all the information in one shot, I can see what I 
have to do much easier. For me the most visual   part, and the one that I really like the most, is 
the buses, when you see the buses moving through   my street. I think once I put the data on the 
dashboard, on the panel, and I saw the buses really   moving, it's like, 'Wow, this is so cool!', and it was so 
easy, when you have the longitude, latitude on your   data source, just put it on the panel and you just 
see the dot moving. So for me, that was that   one moment like, I've been able to do this. 
Just a little bit of data and everything works  like very nice. Everybody in my company, they were 
telling me 'Oh! Why don't you do like a generic for   all the cities, and you start putting all public 
transportation for every... that's kind of crazy. That   was another option that, I just didn't... and 
the notifications. The notifications is something   that I didn't do, but that would be the best. If I 
don't have to check the - I'm always talking about   checking the phone, but if I don't even have 
to check the phone, if I just get a notification, that says, 'It's going to rain. Take the bus, because it's 
going to take 45 minutes." Perfect. I don't have to   do anything else. So that would be the next
step. I would say like, working only for a year and   a half on this product, and I've been able to do 
something like, Grafana likes it because they vote, and   the community likes it because they vote for it too. For my 
family, they are so happy that I'm coming here. That I have recognition after, I don't know, 30 years 
of working, and I never had anything like this. Like,   nobody really recognized my work like this. 
So they are very happy. I think it made me proud   that I'm able to do something cool, and it's like,
I like this like, when people say... gives you the   award, it's like they are telling you, 'Hey, you did 
something good'. So really yeah, I love that.
