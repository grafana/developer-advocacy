Transcript: Hey there! I'm Drew Slobodnjak
from the dataviz squad at Grafana, and I'm happy to share a quick update
on stat visualization. Sometimes less is more. The standard behavior for percent change
in the stat visualization is to color positive percent changes green, and negative
percent changes red, depending on your use case. However, you may want to customize
how percent change color behaves. We have added the option to have
percent change color mode inverted with positive red and negative
green or color match the value. Thanks, from the
dataviz squad at Grafana.
