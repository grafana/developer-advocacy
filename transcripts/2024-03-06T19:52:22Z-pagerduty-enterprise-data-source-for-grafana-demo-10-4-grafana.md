Transcript: [Music] hello so I want to demo the pager Duty data source this is the configuration page and the only thing you need to put here is the API key once this is configured you can start using it so with this data source at the moment you can fetch and list all the incidents or just get the data for a specific incident let's start with listing all incidents you can provide some additional parameters here by default the data source will fetch incidents created within the time frame of the dashboard but you can put some custom dates here as well you can provide some additional parameters like the incident status you want to get or the urgency or service ID team ID whatever let's see how this works so we get some data right but that's a lot of fields I don't want to have that many so I can filter them right in the response parsing option can select some Fields I want to show for example urgency and status then let's add this to the dashboard and then we can also use this data source to get a specific incident right for that we need to provide some idea of the incident I want to show how this works using the variable so if I go to the thir port settings I can add a new variable I'll name it incident so I'll pick the data pag to data source again list incidents and then here I will select I need to select two Fields so one of the first one will be the label and the second one will be the value of the variable so this is my preview and then I go back to the dashboard and then I need to update my query and put the variable here right now this should work yes so now whenever I update this variable I'll get this specific incident right for example if I pick 30 days I'll get more data for the variable actually I need to choose time range change to refresh the data for the variable let's see how this works right so if I pick 90 days yeah I get more and then whenever I change this I get new data here right yes and then the other way you want you can use this data source is to show annotations when the incidents were created for example I use this random walk query and then I will create an annotation again list incidents and then I need to select some Fields here so my time will be created time the title will be summary for example A text will be I don't know status urgency it's enough let's see how this works so these are my annotations right I get the data the title status emergency so that's how this works all the best
