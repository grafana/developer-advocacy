## Summary

In the August edition of the Grafana Campfire community call, moderator Usman introduced the topic of Grafana Drill Down Apps, featuring experts Andrew Stucky and Galen, along with regulars Matt and Carl. The discussion revolved around the functionalities and advantages of the Drill Down Apps, which allow users to analyze logs, metrics, and traces without needing to write complex queries. The speakers highlighted improvements over previous versions, including a more user-friendly interface, the ability to easily navigate between related logs and metrics, and new features such as a JSON visualization panel and an exceptions tab for traces. They emphasized the cultural importance of experimentation within the team, sharing that user feedback significantly influences ongoing development. The session concluded with a reminder about the next community call and an invitation for attendees to engage with Grafana's various observability tools.

# Grafana Campfire Community Call - August Edition

**Usman:**  
Putting on my game face. Okay, so we are live again. Hello everyone, and welcome back to the Grafana Campfire community call for the August edition. Today, we have something really amazing to share. I don't want to spoil it because this is actually one of my favorites. This is something we've been working on behind the scenes, and we recently launched it at Grafana. The topic today is about the Grafana drill down apps.

I will first introduce our special guest for this session, Andrew Stucky. He works on the Grafana drill down apps. We also have Galen with us. Before introducing others, let me introduce myself. My name is Usman, and I work in the Grafana dev team. I also do these campfire calls with Matt and KL. Today, we donâ€™t have David, who is also a regular, but that's all from my side. I will pass it on to Matt.

**Matt:**  
Thank you, Usman. I worked a bit on these drill down apps with this fantastic team we have. I'm still equally excited about this. I think it was a big leap in user experience, and people love it. Iâ€™m excited to dig into it and ask some interesting, tough questions. Iâ€™m going to be hard on this to try and get to the bottom of it. Carl's also here, arenâ€™t you, Carl?

**Carl:**  
I am! My name is Carl Beckist. I'm one of those senior OGs in the Grafana community. I've been at Grafana forever. I have not worked on drill down, but I have used it and love the feature. I think itâ€™s one of the major innovations we've had in Grafana. We had dashboards and data sources for a long time, and then we figured out we needed to take multiple steps ahead of the old contract and really use what Prometheus and Loki have available to build smarter, opinionated solutions. 

It's fun to play a game called "find the Carl" when they show old company photos in internal meetings, as I'm usually in all of them. Itâ€™s like "Whereâ€™s Waldo?" but with me.

**Andrew:**  
Happy to introduce myself! I lead the drill down group, and I get to work with a bunch of wonderful engineers who are very passionate about metrics, logs, traces, and profiles. They've brought all their opinions together to create the drill down apps. By the way, we also own the explore feature, so the same group manages both explorer and drill down, which is pretty neat.

**Galen:**  
Howdy folks! I'm Gayen, and Iâ€™m on the logs squad. I work primarily on the logs drill down experience. Itâ€™s a lot of fun changing how people interact with their Loki data sources.

**Usman:**  
Letâ€™s talk about what was before drill down. What was the experience like?

**Matt:**  
Before drill down, you really had to write your queries yourself. Users had to learn PromQL and LogQL and do a lot of manual work. If you were on the observability data occasionally, you didnâ€™t have the incentive to learn the query language. It could be very time-consuming, especially during incidents.

**Andrew:**  
Exactly! The drill down apps eliminate the need to know how to make or form a query. They let the data drive your next decision. You can see data immediately, spot anomalies, and decide whether to drill deeper without having to write multiple queries.

**Galen:**  
Let me give you an overview of the logs drill down for the Loki data source. The landing page breaks things down by service name, cluster namespace, or your primary labels. Once you identify the service thatâ€™s misbehaving, you can dive right into your logs. You can filter out errors or specific environments to narrow down what you need to focus on.

**Matt:**  
Can you show us how to find this drill down app in Grafana?

**Galen:**  
Sure! In the Grafana menu, we added a new top-level section called drill down. Youâ€™ll see a landing page there for all the installed apps. If you're in a dashboard, you can also reverse the operation and go to drill down for a given query to see related logs or metrics.

**Usman:**  
The Grafana drill down apps are available in all Grafana flavors, whether you're using it on Kubernetes or a Docker image. If youâ€™re not using the latest version, please update, as you'll miss out on new features.

**Andrew:**  
Each drill down app has its unique features that are specific to that signal. They let you see the top-level data and identify interesting areas to drill into.

**Galen:**  
Absolutely! In logs drill down, we can analyze patterns in logs and spot anomalies quickly. It allows you to filter by JSON properties, which is especially useful for deeply nested objects.

**Matt:**  
Are there any specific features youâ€™re particularly excited about?

**Andrew:**  
I really love the new exceptions tab in the traces drill down. It shows exceptions more clearly than before, which is helpful for diagnosing issues.

**Carl:**  
I think itâ€™s great that weâ€™ve made it easier for users who may not be experienced with writing queries to still gain insights quickly.

**Usman:**  
As we wrap up, any final thoughts or questions?

**Galen:**  
Itâ€™s important that we listen to user feedback. We read every piece of feedback we receive and act on it. 

**Matt:**  
We aim to keep improving the drill down apps while keeping the user experience simple and effective.

**Usman:**  
Thank you all for joining todayâ€™s session! We appreciate the participation in the comments and thank our special guests for sharing insights on the drill down apps. We hope to see everyone again next month. Till then, take care! Bye-bye!

**Everyone:**  
Bye! Thanks for having us!

putting on my game face. Okay, so we are live again. So, hello everyone. Welcome back to the Grafana Campfire community call for the August month or the August edition. And today we have something really amazing. I really don't want to spoil this one because this is one of my favorites actually. This is something we were working behind the scenes and we recently launched it at Grafana. So the topic is about the uh graphana drill down apps and today we have some amazing experts. Uh I will first introduce uh uh the one who is only for this session which is Andrew Stucky. Uh he works on the griffana drill down apps and also Galen and uh before introducing others I will first introduce myself and we'll pass along to others. So my name is Usman and I work in the graphana deil team and uh yeah uh I also do these uh campfire calls with Matt and uh KL. Today we don't have David who is also our regular but yeah um that's all from my side and I will pass to Matt. Yeah thank you. Um I worked a bit on these projects these drill down apps um with this fantastic team that we have. Um, I am al I'm still equally excited by this and I think it was a big leap in what we were doing here from that user experience point of view. Um, and people love it still. So, I'm excited as well to dig into it and I've got some interesting some tough questions as well. I'm going to be tough on this to try and be hard ball. Carl's also here, aren't you, Carl? I am. So, my name is Carl Beckist. I'm one of those senior OGs Graphanistas. I've been at Grafana forever. I have not worked on rel but I have used rel and I love the feature. I think it's definitely one of the major innovations we had in Grafana where we had dashboards and data sources forever and then we just figure out like we need to take multiple steps ahead of of the old contract that we have and like really use what Prometheus Loki have available and build smarter opinionated solutions. I think that was a great step for us. And you really have been here so long. So much that anytime they show like internally on slides or whatever they show like old company photos. I play a game called find the call and I just it's as quickly as I can to try and find you in the photos because you're basically in all the photos. Uh it's like where's Waldo or where's Wally. It's really fun. So I recommend it. It's easy on this episode. But so that's my DMs. DMs with Matt Drier is just images of me where I found the car. Yeah. No. Yeah, I recommend it though. Great game. Fun game. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of like the buildown really. You go from the the high level overview. You got to dig in. You know, I'm zooming around. So, it's is appropriate and very well I think placed. Yeah. They don't that didn't feel forced at all. Yeah. It's not forced, is it? It's good. I like how natural this is. Okay. Yeah. So, maybe you can introduce yourself. Happy to. Yeah. So, I did indeed work with Matt and I do work with Gayen. Matt was kind of like our our backseat vibe coder while he was with us. Well, taken. Never mind. Go on. What were you saying? Yeah. So, so I'm Andrew. I uh I lead the the drill down group and I get to work with a bunch of wonderful engineers that are very passionate about, you know, metrics, logs, traces, and profiles. and they've brought all of their opinions together to bring us the drill down apps. And by the way, we also own the explore feature still. So like the same group owns both explorer and drill down which is pretty neat. We'll get into more of that later. Gayen, introduce yourself. Howdy folks. Uh I'm uh like Andrew said, I'm uh Gayen. I'm on the log squad. Um I'm working primarily on the the logs drill down uh experience and yeah doing that since since the onset and yeah it's a it's a lot of fun kind of changing the way that people get to interact with their uh Loki data sources. Nice. So uh let's talk about like why what was before drill down? Maybe we can have some background of it. Yeah. What was before drill down? Do you remember? I I don't know. Matt, do you remember what was before drill down? Um yes, it was a lot of you you really have to write the queries yourself. That was really it. And pro, you know, people would learn I mean they learn PromQL, learn logql, these different query languages. And I would always use I kind of had enough to be able to do basic things, but every time I needed to do something more advanced, I would have to do I'd have to learn it essentially. Um, and yeah, so that's kind of a challenge. And I think for a lot of people, if if you're using it every day, it makes sense you're going to learn these tools. They're so powerful. Um, and you can do so much with them. But if you're say you're an engineer and you're only dipping even occasionally into the observability data, you don't really have that incentive to properly learn the query language so that you can be really advanced at it. Um and so you it ends up being quite yeah spend quite a lot of time trying to get the answers that you need or often be like bug somebody else who knows better usually Sirill or someone uh who's been doing it a lot longer. Yeah. having having to learn query language during an incident is is not a fun experience. And yeah, freeing people from that that feels good. Yeah, it's like an escape room. It's like you've got to figure out where the hieroglyphs are and then you line it up, then you got to go upstairs and get a clue and then come down and pick a card and if it's red, then the door opens. It's that kind of thing. But it's even worse because like the first time you go to the room, the room's empty because like you would you would drop in to explore and there would be nothing there. Just a blank page. You're like, "This is great. What do I do next?" Yeah. And it did it did advance. It did evolve because there's like query builders, the UI that guides you into into building queries. And I found that useful, but you're still thinking about the query. And if you want to learn the query and how to write these queries, then uh it's actually quite useful to be able to do that. Um, drill down apps just completely takes away any need to even know about a query altogether, doesn't it? Yeah. And not only does it take away needing to know how to make or form a query, but I think the part that was most exciting to me was that we let the data drive your next decision. So you you get to see data immediately and then you can spot an anomaly and decide whether or not you want to drill into the next level. Uh where I feel like if you're writing queries, you have to figure out like the highest level query to write, then tweak it, write the next query. And so it's not just one query you ended up writing. You end up needing to write a bunch. And I think that was like a compounding effect. Yeah, I feel like we should have a look at the drill down app just just to uh get everyone up to speed on this. Um how about we do that Gayen and you give us an overview. Yeah, absolutely. Um so yeah, taking a look at uh logs drill down uh for the Loki data source. Um, so yeah, uh, basically the landing page instead of that, uh, empty, uh, scary query interface that Andrew was talking about, um, we just break things down primarily starting by, uh, service uh, uh, service name, which is pretty pretty common. But also if you you know want to take a look at cluster namespace or whatever your uh primary labels are uh for your data source you can go ahead and do that. Um yeah so once you kind of identify the service that you think is misbehaving or you got alerted on go ahead and dive in. Can either if you're already ready to start debugging you can get jump right into your logs. Maybe you want to just start by filtering out everything other than errors. And again, if you're, you know, maybe for smaller data sets, you might be ready to look at your logs already, but it's always a good idea to kind of try to remove any sort of uh extraneous information. Um, so let's say, all right, we know that this is only a problem in production. So, let's go ahead filter out any dev and uh other environments there. And let's say from there this is all automatically generated data. So, it's kind of hard to to simulate like an actual incident, but you can dive into the individual fields that are being extracted out of your logs and kind of get a uh a more robust understanding of maybe uh what is there a pod that's, you know, sending off a whole bunch more logs than the others? Something looks weird that you want to continue to drill your query down. And then from there, you might say, "Okay, now now I'm ready. Oh, I want to looks like this is a service that has uh JSON logs." Um, we actually just rolled out a new JSON visualization which is going to be released GA probably next week. Um, supposedly um if everything goes well. And that's kind of neat because when you're looking at the logs, sometimes there's an overwhelming amount of JSON which is kind of hard to deal with. And the JSON viz is kind of special in the way that you can filter out drill down into very specific chunks of your JSON structure to to debug there. Also, what's kind of neat is you can filter by the JSON structure. So if you say okay I only want to see logs that contain this deeply nested object you can go ahead and do that. Um whereas before that would require some pretty complicated logql um and some some poking and proddding that no one wants to do um especially when you're trying to respond quickly to an incident. Yeah. So it could you go to that labels tab again because this is this is like um Yeah. So, like you don't really do anything special for this, do you? You're just basically putting your logs into Loki and then you get this experience. And how is this built? How would how does it decide what it's going to show on this this page for example or the fields page? Um, it's just so whatever the the labels which are kind of like the the index uh in Loki. So, however those are instrumented um they'll automatically get uh pulled into these tabs here. And then the fields are kind of less uh to do with your instrumentation and more to what's on the actual log lines that that get ingested. So um whatever fields maybe actually the table makes it easier uh to just kind of see of all of the log lines that are ingested on this set of labels like the whatever key value pairs that are in those objects just automatically get extracted and in the fields tab we're just showing you the count of the logs that have that particular label name and then from there yeah if you want to dive more into values um you can break things out more and see if there's any anomalies there as well. So if there was like a a DOS attack let's say and it was coming from a particular like it had a particular property in it like you know the same number of bytes or something you would see in this kind of view you see it stand out don't you? There's like a big spike that's just very clear. Yeah. Oh yeah absolutely. Yeah. So if one of your pods, you know, was getting hit with way more traffic, um, and it was emitting logs at a greater rate, yeah, it would stand out here. You could sort by count or the most relevant here. Kind of does some some ML magic to pull things that have the more anomalous data to the top. Um, but yeah, so that's kind of a a way to quickly kind of uh spot again uh anomalies or things that might be unexpected. And then from there you can, you know, drill down um and uh kind of get a smaller set of logs to deal with which will maybe help you figure out uh how to fix the actual problem. Yeah, it's so good in it. And Galen, can you please uh uh show the audience like how they can find this uh drill down app in if they're using Graphana? Oh yeah. So obviously so uh in the kind of the uh graphana menu here we added a couple versions ago a new top level section called drill down. Uh there's kind of a landing page there for all the apps that are installed where you'll see the links to logs, metrics, traces, profiles, apps in there. Um also there are some other neat ways that you can do this as well. So, let's say imagine I'm coming. Oh, nope. I can't do new tabs. Sorry, folks. Bear with me. So, let's say maybe you are in a dashboard. Oh, no. This is play it won't let me do that. Well, we'll just assume that uh explore will work. But you're writing your query manually or you're coming from a dashboard. You can kind of do the reverse operation where you say, "Okay, I want to go to drill down for a given query." and it'll populate those fields here. And you can always do the opposite uh uh situation as well where if you're in drill down and maybe you're ready to take that to explore to uh kind of tweak that query or to add it to a dashboard for every single panel in uh logs drill down you can always pull the rip cord and then go to explore and go back. So yeah, it should be should be pretty easy jumping around back and forth. Yeah. And to the folks uh uh Graphfana drill down apps is now available in all Grafana flavors like if you're using maybe um on Kubernetes or or maybe using the Docker image, you should find a Graphana drill down if you're using the latest version of Graphana. If not, then please update it because then you're missing a bunch of new features uh which we recently just released. Yeah, this is very cool. Can we also look at the patterns because I think that each each drill down app also has its own particular flavor because they're all this kind of idea, aren't they? Where you see the top level thing and you can spot from that interesting areas to drill into. Um, but they also have their own unique little bits and pieces that specific to that signal, don't they? Yeah. So yeah, patterns yeah is very cool, very powerful uh feature available in the logs drill down. So basically Loki will go through all your logs and uh kind of figure out the bits that change and kind of group them into kind of things that are more similar. So um in this particular service, oh you can see that all right, there's lots of logs that info logs coming from this flush.go go um uh file with this message and then the only thing that really changes is the timestamp and the user ID and the block ID. So it allows you to quickly I mean this is kind of again a situation where everything is behaving as expected but again if we had like a DDoS like Matt said earlier or something else you'd see a big spike of maybe or a pattern that didn't exist before in the past and it's suddenly there um would kind of be a real good signal that oh okay hold on something something unexpected is happening in my infrastructure. So you can quickly kind of say, okay, well, I've let's pretend that this one had a big spike or it didn't exist before. You can just go ahead and include that pattern. And now all of the logs that you see are going to be much more uh consistent coming from matching exactly that pattern. Yeah, it's fast as well, isn't it? It's pretty cool. Um, Andrew, this this essentially is writing the queries on your behalf and each little panel is its own query. Um, is that not just the equivalent of kind of DDoSing the database? 100%. How are they how did they take that at first? Not so great. And it's it's funny when you look at where queries are coming from. So, so we have a couple internal dashboards where we can check query percentage like how many of these are are queries coming from dashboards from explore from drill down and drill down in most cases makes up for more than 50% of all queries made not only because they're popular but but also because they they happen to just like slam the database with queries. But the team uh responded to that challenge very well and they yeah they're sort of adapting and evolving the back end also to to support this kind of experience and I think that's um yeah that's just kind of great and I I just think it makes such a big difference. Uh before you know you'd have to know what query to do to even get something that showed a spike. So, you kind of already have to know what the problem is to some extent. Uh, or at least you're going to be exploring and trying lots of different things to look around. Unless you've had that problem before, of course, and you've got your um your alerts all set up and everything in your dashboards. But yeah, just the fact that you this presents the data for you. Um, and and and I don't know, something about that makes that that experience is just a lot easier to deal with for me. Um, more visual, I guess. Yeah, same for me like I I can share my experience like I do a lot of testing on on my local machine and every time before drill down I have to like at least copy paste or remember some query and then create a dashboard. This is a unique way like you don't need to really remember anything like if you have a configuration all set and you just go to the drill down it will give you the most both like basic metrics uh or the logs or whatever you have defined beyond maybe traces or uh profile you can get it at instance so this saves a lot of time like for me if I'm developing something I can cut my time and start show seeing the results which I need to so Yeah, I think not only did we want these experiences to be like customuilt for each database, so they they kind of are like superpowers for our databases, but but also we wanted to have an app for each signal to meet people where they are at. Like personally, I'm most comfortable with logs and traces. So, like if I'm trying to root cause something or diagnose an issue, like my first stop is probably going to be traces. If it's a system that has multiple services or if it's just one service, I'm probably going to head into logs. But that's me personally. I know other people who are more comfortable with metrics. And so, they're going to be most comfortable starting in metrics to diagnose their issue. So by having this by having these all as individual apps wherever you are most comfortable like that's where where you should start and we're getting better and better at connecting the experiences together. So if you were most comfortable with metrics we found a metric that was anomalous we have a related logs feature which allows you to view log lines that are related to labels applied to this metric. So if this metric had a filter that was like checkout service, you would see all the logs for your checkout service as it relates to that. Or if you had a recording rule between uh you know Loki, you would see you know related metrics there as well which is really neat. Yeah, that is cool. Uh and I suppose others other other signal too like into traces from logs and things like this if you see a trace ID and stuff like that and vice versa. Yeah. From traces to logs and traces to profiles. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. Um any do you want are there any other like features? What's your favorite feature of this Andrew? Oh, my favorite feature. It's a new one actually. It's something I've wanted for a while. I don't know if we we have it in this demo environment, but in traces drill down, there is a new tab called exceptions. So, if you were to Yep, I don't see it in this environment. Uh, but when when you're looking at actually select errors real quick, it might be here. Um, because there are some errors. Yeah, there we go. it there it's detecting zero exceptions but there are error traces and I find sometimes error traces are are a bit overwhelming there can be a lot of of traces that are marked as error like anyone can set the status to a trace to error for for whatever reason at whatever point in their code uh sometimes it's indicative of something it's not but exceptions on the other hand are are quite clear that something has gone wrong and this is this is when a trace span has an event that has an exception attached to it. And so, yeah, here's 46 that are that are on this one. So, if you click exceptions, you'll see that this exception has been thrown 46 times. And the last exception, China is not allowed. I guess I guess not. What's that mean? What's that mean? Did do we block China from playing? Don't know. I I think this is more Yeah. automatically generated data. That's probably true. Cool. Yeah. Well, that what could go wrong? What could go wrong? But I I really love this feature because uh coming from a a background in Java where exceptions are a really common pattern, I find this immensely helpful. Yeah, I love that though that these are uh like it isn't like explore is the advanced tool where you can query this all the same kind of data. Uh but these are practical useful applica like apps essentially built on top of that right so um and I love that that yeah we do that but how do how do you decide like where to go how do you decide what work to work on what what problems to solve oh that's a great question I I think like culturally we are very experiment driven and I I think this comes with pros and cons, but the pros are that we try a lot of things, we make a lot of bets, and we we know going into implementing an idea that it might not work out. And that's okay. Like, we've built this this culture of safety and trust that it's our right to deprecate a feature that wasn't successful. But I think that also means at some level you can't get too attached to your own ideas if they aren't successful. And we high we like hold successes up very high and we we get very excited when they're when they are successful. But we have our failures too and we we also hold those high. We have deprecated a lot of features and actually we we deprecated a feature in traces drill down. Um if you close the trace view here you see the drop down next to all spans root there's like root spans all spans and then there's that drop down. This is called the primary signal. And this was initially more kind of tabs along the top, but it made that bar quite long. And we didn't think people were using these other primary signal filters. So, we removed it. And about a week later, we got a bunch of people reaching out saying, "Hey, where' the primary signal go? We really loved this feature." So, it was like we thought people weren't using it. We deprecated it and turns out like people did find a lot of value there. we we were just trying to make the UI more simple, more straightforward and in the process we removed something that a lot of people were using. Um but we heard that feedback and we readded it so you can still filter by you know database traces or whatever it is that you want to look at. Yeah. I but I think your point is such a good one that it's okay to fail because if you don't have that as part of the culture, it means basically people have to just get it right the first time and they can spend so much time trying to make sure you don't make a mistake that actually it's quicker sometimes to just often to just build a few versions of things and try it um and get it out. Yeah. So that but that's interesting. So it is worth so it is worth sending in feedback then because you you're listening to what people say. We read every single piece of feedback that we receive and we we act on a little. Have you ever had any brutal feedback? Oh yeah. I suppose it's the internet. There have been a couple where where it's like why can't I write a query and drill down? Uh and like to some extent I think this comes out of fear that maybe we'll deprecate explore one day but that's never been our goal. I think explore and drill down will continue to coexist for for a long time. Explorer will be always the place where you can manually write a query and it's also the the big tent uh area for for graphana like these drill down apps were only ever designed for our databases for Mir Prometheus Loki Tempo and Pyroscope but if you have any of the other hundreds of data sources that we offer like you're going to interact with those through explore so explore isn't going anywhere and that was also one of the na reasons behind our rename to drill Because if if you remember like these were originally the explore apps. We called them explore logs, explore metrics. Uh and that was kind of confusing for folks too because I think people Yeah. It it it definitely confused because it it sounded like oh explore is evolving and then the name was changed and then it makes more clarity that we have dedicated drill down app for for our own data data sources. Exactly. Uh, and it was confusing. We were talking to people asking them like, "Hey, have you seen the new explore apps?" And they were like, "Oh, I don't want to write a query." And we're like, "Well, I don't think you're getting it. Like, the explore apps are totally different." It was Yeah, it was a pain. I think we all felt it made so much sense at the time. I think this is also one of like coming back to how we work internally by moving quickly and trying things like we didn't want to get hung up. We joke that as programmers naming things is the hardest part of the job and that is largely true. So we were like all right let's not worry too much about the name. Let's just ship these awesome features and figure out the name later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um and I I think I I see somewhere like we see on the screen histogram by duration. Was there also like a heat map uh panel already integrated in drill draw? Or maybe my eyes were playing lies. Yes, we we do we have um native histograms implemented in in metrics for Mamir which is pretty neat. What is that? Um so Prometheus has the ability to render you know regular histograms but the the architecture never delivered super high fidelity at performance. So the Prometheus uh team had been working on you know these these higher powered uh histograms that were kind of native to the Prometheus architecture and I think it was a multi-year effort you know one of those things where you have to to convince a lot of people this is the right idea and agree on the the ideal architecture but you know once it was delivered it's it's pretty neat it definitely is more efficient more cost-effective and um provides higher fidelity when you're looking at a histogram. Yeah, I see. Yeah. Very cool. I saw some right there. I don't think they're native histograms, but they are, you know, they are histograms nonetheless. It looks nice as well, doesn't it? It does. like it's very visually pleasing for some how how many uh how many different versions of like columns did you experiment with all of the all the options yeah I like this I like I feel like you got it got it right for sure um and I hope so yeah so and it only queries when you look at the panels too right so correct even though it can be lots in there in that initial view as you scroll down. It's Yep. It'll load lazy load more as you as you go. It's quick. It's quick. It's fast. Yeah. Yeah. Carl, you write you you can write queries, can't you? You've been at Grafana for so long. I'm fairly good at writing queries. Yeah. I spend a lot of time in Explore to be honest. Right. Uh yeah. Yeah. I I like this though. I I I really like the fact that we can use the our databases core capabilities more than explore and I like the click click part of the UI. But um I got to admit that I spend more time in explore if anything. Yeah. But I think that's if you're if you are experienced this isn't going to really replace that because explore is always going to be more powerful probably. Yeah. And that's why I have gray hair and yeah, you know, all these things. Yeah. But if you want to avoid gray hair and not get stressed out, drill down apps. Yeah. No, no. I I'm I'm really keen on this um these apps. I think they're very good. Yeah. I I know other people that use kind of use both um those, you know, they'll start in the drill down apps and then they'll Yeah. they have their own workflows or whatever else that they're used to doing and they can just always nip into explore from here like we showed the the two-way movement. and and the mix. I can kind of see a need for that where I start fiddle in classic explorer and I kind of select the dimensions I care about and from there I want to go to drill down the drill down into it especially when it come to logs. So it's kind of a starting point. Yeah. Can you always do that from explore to logs because doesn't it what if they write a query that you can't represent in a drill down app? Oh, just the labels. Like the labels I think you can always Yeah. get in there, right? Because you choose your cluster, your machine, your node, your pod, not actual content. This is a really good way of dealing with the content from that long output. Yeah. Oh, very cool. And can I can I ask a question about exceptions earlier? Can I see the rate pair exception? So if if there's a new kind of exception, I want to see that trending differently than others because there's always tend to be this like noisy level of exceptions and that's fine. One cares. But if a new exception spikes up, that's very relevant. Yep. Yeah. It's very similar to patterns in the way where it's got the little frequency graph. So if you if you look here, yeah, expand the time out a bit. Oh, nice. You can you can determine fairly easily. Is this like a new exception? And this one looks like it's been around for a while. It's still firing, but it's probably not a new exception. China's never been allowed. Exactly. Evidently. Yeah. Yeah. I love a spark line, by the way. Spark line's great. Yeah. This this it's shockingly useful because you're right. Like if it starts suddenly or spikes suddenly or or maybe it did spike and it's fine now like you can just get all of that information at a glance. It's worth spending some time and thinking about what that spark line means I think to learn. But this is yeah this is very good. And I suppose I mean what the the the squads the teams work uh like they deliver a lot of new features all the time, don't they? Totally. Um should we should we have a little look at maybe what's new and what's coming soon and talk a bit about that? That could be exciting. I'm sure I'm sure the list of what's new isn't uh all-incclusive and I really focused when when putting this together on like basically the things that we've shipped in the last you know month or two mostly. So uh yeah to give you an idea of of what you'll be looking at in the what's new with Drillown. Go ahead and do I can I move the slides? I can move the slides. Cool. It's good isn't it? Yeah it is good. Professional. Professional. Yeah, worldwide, wide, wide. Uh, at Croponic, we announced that all of the drill down apps were generally available. I feel like it's good just to to I I love this visual because it shows what each app kind of looks like and and the fact that they are all generally available in both open source and in cloud. So, basically, everyone has access to this. If you're not using them yet, give them a give them a go. As far as what's new, I've broken it down into each app. So, we'll start with metrics and and look at what's what we're doing there. One feature we built in metrics was the ability to look at individual panels and see where these metrics are being used. So, you'll see a little count in the lower left hand corner. In this case, this metric is being used in one dashboard, but we've seen cases where a metric is used in eight or 20 dashboards. And at Graphonicon, someone actually approached us and they they requested this feature to be able to look at all the dashboards because they were going through a migration where they had a set of new metrics and old metrics and they wanted to see where the old metrics were still being used. So they could go deprecate or migrate those dashboards to use the new metric. So it was a pretty pretty neat use case and we were able to to bring the feature to them. Is is there an API that lets you do that search then? How does that actually work? Yeah, there is. I I guess. Turns out I didn't know one existed. We We were like, "This would be an awesome feature. Let's see if it's possible." And then we did a couple day research spike and came back with, "Yeah, it is definitely possible." All right. I need that API. API. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good. Oh, by the way, you can also uh sort your metrics by dashboard usage, which is a pretty cool feature. So if you want to see most used metrics by a dashboard usage, you can you can also sort sort there. Is it is it also useful to know that this metric doesn't appear on any dashboards like this is not really being tracked or monitored or Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah, by the way, Matt Fine has done a shameless plug here. Just wants to say that Graphfana meetup in Austin, Texas is coming focused on the metrics drill down app in September. Um, so shameless plug there, Matt, but it's I suppose it's fine really. Yeah, Matt actually is one of our Graphana Champions user and he's very active on our Graphana community. So, yeah, he's uh very excited to host this meetup. So, thanks Matt for for sharing this here as well so it can get more voice. Yeah. And brilliant name I think has to be said. Is it a real name? Is that his real name you think? Or seems fake, doesn't it? It's fine. It's fine. It literally is. Uh Andrew, I I I do have a question. So the the feature which you mentioned that you can see the uh dashboard uses like uh in the previous slide. Is this feature also available on the graphana oss as well? I yeah I believe so. I think most of the features we build are are available in both in both locations. um you know both for open source users and for cloud users we really try to make them as accessible as possible um and we put a lot of thought and care into that. Cool. Thanks. Yeah. Uh we talked about this one briefly earlier, but the fact that you can if you're looking at a metric view its related logs. And I I think this was one of those features where we we thought about it. We thought it would be really neat, but we didn't know if folks would actually use it. And uh data tells us and and you know that this is quite heavily used. Uh so I like to show it off when when I can because I think it's a neat feature. There there will be times when you're looking at a metric and there's zero related logs as a as a results because you know sometimes you'll be looking at a CPU metric from a node exporter and that's not going to give you a ton of a ton of data because there aren't any logs to be linked to it. But when you have application specific logs this is quite good at picking up application specific metrics and logs. It's pretty good at picking up the connection. And how does that work? Do you have to do something special in your telemetry data? Uh it this approach kind of naively assumes that your labels roughly match between metrics and logs. So there there is some assumptions baked in. But even if you don't have labels that match, we have a heristic that'll kind of go through and check some other things too like are using uh recording rules, recorded queries, like are are there ways to connect your data otherwise? And a lot of times those those measures work quite well as well. And I see the button there open in logs drill down. So you can jump straight into the other app which is cool. Yeah. Pretty good. Pretty good. It's one of those features that sort of feels like magic. It does when you're using it. It is pretty magical. Yeah. Uh next is what's new in logs drill down. And we also touched a bit on some of these, but to call them out more specifically, we have a new logs panel. And the the previous logs panel that we had was was quite old. It had served us well. But as we grew with our customers and our customers scale grew, our needs shifted a bit and we needed something that was more performant. Hotel was is now a thing that wasn't around really when we when we built the old logs panel. So the the two things we really wanted to to solve here were like is do we have a platform we can build upon that makes reading hotel logs easier and can we make it more performant in the process and we were able to deliver. So you you'll see this rolling out um soon. It's already available for most cloud environments and will be coming to to open source shortly I believe. This is cool. And just uh let you know that our very own Sven Janeer loves the new logs panel. They say it's so fast. So fast. So there you go. Live review. Thank you, Sven. And hello. Brilliant. Pairing with the logs panel, we have the JSON panel. And this is uh this is Galen's pride and joy. So maybe I'll let him talk about it for a second. Is this your baby, Gayen? Jason. Yes. Uh it it is. Um so so yeah, it's something yeah we're planning on rolling out uh generally available uh in the next week or two. Um but yeah, basically kind of again just kind of a another way of interacting with your JSON logs, allowing you to fil easily quickly filter by JSON properties. And for heavily deeply nested objects, it allows you to kind of trim out some of the noise and only visualize like certain subnodes of your JSON document um without being kind of overwhelmed by everything. Um but yeah, so please if you have JSON logs, uh I suggest you take a look at it and play around and if you have any suggestions, uh feel free to there's always that give feedback link in the top right. Otherwise, you can uh uh find us in the logs drill down slack channel in the community slack and uh also in the community forum. I think there's a category for uh logs drill down which we are uh uh watching carefully as well. So yeah. Well, we already got your first review. Um looks like it's a game changer for Matt Fine. Um Matt cannot wait to try it out. When can Matt try it? Um, anytime now. Um, it's been available experimentally for I don't know three months plus. Um, and um, recently we we've kind of put a little polish on it and and uh kind of uh worked on some optimization and some other things. Uh so but I I can't remember the exact graphana version probably 115 uh or maybe even 114 um if you but you can be on uh 115 and still pull the latest version of log still down um as well. But if you just set things up back at 114, you probably have an older version of logs drill down. Um, but it should still have the JSON uh panel as well. Maybe that's something to highlight that we deploy the drill down apps independently from core graphana. They they kind of get bundled together. So if you download the open source version of of graphana, uh if you have an internet connection, they will get pre-installed. So, so it might be disingenuous to say like bundle. They're not in the same binary, but they get automatically installed in in open source graphana and you can update the plugins independently of of graphana core, which is pretty neat. Ah, so if I understood correctly, like if I'm using the open source, I have to install as as a part of data source or as a plug-in to get a plugin. Okay, cool. Didn't know about it. Yeah. And actually that that was my question because I I I see like we are implementing and creating like all these log panels. It seems non like drill downon is also may have in future its own application maybe a side application like we have apps right now drill on apps or maybe maybe have log apps because the implementation looks something uh right now already very uh advanced but we probably may not want to complicate it as well. Is it true like maybe we go a little bit more beyond the drilled on apps in future for at least for the logs part have it own dedicated logs app I think that's largely how we developed logs drill down I think we will probably go down the path of uh exposing more components that other apps can consume. So in graphana there's a concept of exposed components which allow us to like as developers expose a set of components that someone else could use in another application. And I think that's probably where we're headed is we'll expose some of these base components we've used to build logs drill down all the drill down apps. That way if you're an app developer you can pull them into your own app if if needed. And this has been uh kind of an instrumental shift for some of our features we've built in cloud like graphfana assistant or uh our our oi suite of products like assert surf front end observability where they can use the superpower of drill down within their applications. So you you'll see drill down in some of these logs panel log panels in in more places. Yeah. Yeah. And Josiah Solomon loves this. So I love these live reviews. Just judging what Andrew is saying live. I love it. So Josiah is also like one of our top contributor on the Graphana community and he's also a Grafana champion. So he he he was speaking about this I think sometime in the past. So yeah, Josie, your wish come true. Nice. Back to what's new. Uh, moving on to the next thing. This is also something I believe Gayen worked on not too long ago, but one of the core thesises of drill down was like let the data drive your next decision. So you see the fields volume on the left and this allows you to apply those fields labels to narrow the log lines that you see and and you visually get to look at which fields might have the most interesting data that you want to filter by. But there's also this use case where maybe these panels are very noisy or you have a ton of different fields that you could filter from and you don't want to scroll through a bunch of panels. There is now a toggle which lets you switch between viewing the volume histograms or switching over just to view the the names of the fields to to filter that way. And this is a bit more performant if you have a lot of fields. Yeah, it's uh it's so fast. So fast. I'm really sorry, Carl. When we put these little banners up, it just completely covers your face and I can't play. Where's Carl? I'm glad Carl's at the bottom and not me. Can Can you try to put it again? I might may be able to move the banner. Just highlight it again, Matt. Okay. So fast. Uh, no. I don't think you should move it. I think you should just leave it there. Sorry. I see. So, this is cool. So, this is um literally fast faster. A lot faster, right? Yeah. So, it's not It doesn't have to go and it doesn't hammer the database. So, I bet the I bet the Loki team are f fans of this one. I think they love this tab. They love this. Yeah. Yeah. Um Josiah says, "Carl, have you considered a bigger head?" Oh, I can zoom in more maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Next time. Next time. Brilliant. What's the traces? Traces. Yeah. I mean, we we kind of touched on some of these already, so I don't expect all of them to be super surprising, but we readded the primary signal. And yeah, I think it makes sense if you think about how people want to filter their traces. If you want to look at spans that are only from your server, only from uh asynchronous consumer or a database call, uh it's it's a powerful opinionated filter that you can apply. And how do you how which one should you pick? Is it a case of you you know because you know or like how do you figure it out? And I think that's why we originally simplified it and removed it was because like maybe you want to look at all your spans or or only your root spans to try to sus out what's going wrong. But I think when people have a hunch of what's going wrong and they're like, "Oh, you know, I really think there's a slow database query happening here." They're going to want to filter and only see the database calls. or if they know for a fact this is a serverside issue, they're going to look at server specific traces or segments of those traces as opposed to front end. So it really helps reduce some of the noise. Yeah. Nice. And then my favorite, is it fast, Andrew? Is it fast? Yeah, I think anytime we can reduce anytime we can reduce the data and make it a little smaller, it's fat. Great. Yeah, definitely. My favorite feature, the exceptions tab gets highlighted again. Um, it's very cool. And this this error looks less problematic as well, which is quite nice. It's a it's a problematic error. This is actually from my own uh personal project that I that I have been running. Awesome. Yeah. So, this is uh this is my TV remote. when you when you press a button uh it gets sent up to uh up to tempo and you know also logs and metrics. So there was a a problem I was having with my remote where when I turned the volume up it's supposed to send a a message to the TV to tell it the volume level. So it'll say like volume 27 dB. Right. Right. and it would increment the volume on the on the receiver, but it wouldn't send the message back up to the DV telling me the the current volume level. Uh, so I was using traces drill down to figure out what the issue was. Or or did you check the remote was not from the neighbor's house? I hope they don't have the same remote as me. Why? They're allowed to have that remote. It would be weird if their activity started showing up in here. I think they have to steal the remote in order to to have the remote. Is it like a a dev kit kind of remote or something? Yeah, it's actually another open source project called Omote. Uh if you want to if you want to Google it, it's pretty neat. So yeah, you can open source create your own your own remote. Wow, that does sound fun. You know, fun fun if you if you're into uh that sort of thing. And when now did you fix it then? Did you figure out what was Yeah, I did. Oh, that was really really quick. So fast sounds of it. It was only fast because of drill down. Right. Cool. And so this is So but now you've got exceptions to worry about with your remote. I know. So what's the exception? You you could really Yeah, I went too far with it, you know? Yeah. Good. So moving on, Andrew. Yeah. Do you know remote work? Do you know what this You know what that means, right, Andrew? I don't know. Maybe I'll throw an exception. Yep. Thanks, man. Who knew I'd get heckled uh here? I know. Yeah, this is actually I'm going to encourage this more troll live trolling of of the guests. I feel like this is this is our angle, especially your former manager, Sven. You know, you no longer report to me, so it's free game, I suppose. Yeah. Yes. Sven was we should also say uh instrumental in the building of the uh logs um drill down also, right? Yeah. Yeah. He also contributed to to Loki to make some of these features possible. Cool. Yeah. So that's cool. And that's an interesting point as well because you know people ask why is it only your databases that you're building these for? um you know other other tools in Grafana are big tent but it really is about that isn't it because you need specific things to change sometimes in the back end in order to be able to deliver these do you do you see a future where there might be uh other apps no no probably not I mean there's there's definitely a possibility but I feel like they would have to be built specific to that database it like if you try to build some generic abstraction that works for all logs, data sources, you end up building for the lowest common denominator, which is really painful. SQL could go wrong. Yeah, it's almost like a mic drop there, but I suppose it'd be a table drop. That was good, wasn't it? Yeah, that was a good joke, wasn't it, everyone? What do you think, Sven? Yeah, it was very fast. Thank you, Sven. Okay. What about profiles? Is is anything new in that or just keeping it as it is? It's so fast. It helps you. Where's the carpet? So fast. So fast. Figures out how to make things fast. If not, yeah. Yeah, that's true. This is how you make things fast. It's true. So, profiles has been in this place where it it been very stable and then and solves most of the use cases for our users already. But there's a couple nice things we've been looking to add and one of them is the ability to create recording rules from profiles. And so that's a new feature that's been added. And you know, this is kind of the groundwork for uh computing metrics from your profiles, alerting on um profiles. So something was previously working quite fast and is no longer working quickly is no longer so fast, you could you could alert on it. Uh which is pretty neat. And I think that's the end of the slides. Those are the that's the roundup. I'm sure I missed a thing here or there, but lot lots of other little improvements and fixes and stuff. Every time I use it, there's new things which uh yeah, and honestly, I really do appreciate the balance that you strike as well between adding features while keeping it kind of simple minimalist sort of experience cuz Yeah. too many features, it becomes like explore. Um, and I sort of like I like the simplicity of it. So, but I know that's not easy to do. So, yep, it's a challenge. Yeah. Um, we Oh, okay. We actually got a question which I was about to ask. Oh, that's a good sign. Is it? Yeah. Uh, it seems like chat is very good today. Uh, so we got a question from Jungle Jolt Narratives. H, very fancy name. So, hi. Could you share the key? Mr. and Mrs. Mr. and Mrs. Narratives. You've just given birth to a healthy baby. Have you got any ideas for a name that you might be considering? Yeah, we've been thinking about Jungle Jolt. Okay. All right. Sure. You do you. Yeah. Good question, though. Yeah. So I I will just repeat it out loud so everyone hears. So yeah could you share the key difference between the drill down apps and explore and any tips for using drill down apps with open telemetry. I will start with the open telemetry bit because I feel like we already covered a bit of the drill down versus explore but uh that's the that's the neat thing. You don't really have to do anything special uh with open telemetry or drill down to take advantage of it. they're pretty aware of each other and we're we're becoming more and more opinionated about what we should how we should handle OTEL telemetry data by the day. So, it's only going to get better and and you really don't have to do anything other than send your data to a graphana database in OTEL format. Nice. And then as it relates to the key differences, I think to repeat like it's really if you want to write a query, use explore. If you don't want to write a query, use drill down. And I see them as uh you know more compatible with with each other, more complimentary with each other and less of I'm going to use one or the other. I think you can use both. Nice. And uh when it comes to open telemetry like uh the drill down app uh is compatible to uh to show all these metrics logs uh either it use if someone uses the uh native hotel or also with our graphana alloy. Is it correct? Yep. Okay. Cool. It is correct. It's actually how I send all all of my data to uh to graphana solid hotel works really well. So we dog food it too. I think that's another key component to how we work is like I think each one of us are very passionate about observability and we dog food it uh ourselves so we know when something isn't isn't working quite as well as we want it to. Yeah. Uh folks, we are actually a little bit run out of time. We are over two minutes and uh so um I don't see any more questions here. So yeah, we can wrap it up for this uh August session. Uh really it went really I mean I hate to say it but that really was that went so quickly, didn't it? Yep. I didn't get to heckle Matt as much as I wanted. So yeah, there's that. next time. You managed to get one dig in which which I won't forget, but I did right at the beginning, too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Straight out of the out of the gate. It was good. You're welcome to the chat next time, Andrew. Honestly, the the the hate gets a lot of clicks. It's all with love. It's all love really. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Okay. Yeah. Then uh because there is one other graphana uh live session is already in place so we can close this one. But yeah, thanks again everyone for joining in especially for the folks in comments and thank you to to our special guests who explain this drill down apps very nicely and show us some amazing features. And as always uh yeah uh you can always join our graphana campfire community which happens every month. So, next month we will probably see each other again. Till then, take care. Bye-bye. Bye. Thanks for having us. Bye-bye. Bye. Now, just smile like while the music plays at the end. You just have to do that.
