Transcript: Cool. So um this is the last session for today ops session Singapore. So I'm between all of you and happy hours. Um I believe we have 30 minutes for this. We have very exciting lineup with us here from cloud provider partner system integrator and practitioner as well when we talk about obsibility journey. Right. So before we get started to the hot topics, why don't we start with an introductions? Who are you? Where are you from? And of course, what do you do in a company? Allesio, you want to kick us off? Um, I'm Allesio. I work for AWS. Been there five years. Um, part of a team that helps digital native customers uh the grab of the of the world. And uh um before I was a practitioner though, funny story um I used to build my product which is a digital wallet u based out of Hong Kong on Azure. So I've seen how observability works on Azure on AWS and uh um yeah happy to be here. Um I I'm Jun Hongchu. You can call me Jun, right? And I'm a lead cloud engineers from right. So ino my team um specialize in providing consultations and uh implementation service as well right uh on the cloud um architecture and and cloud uh solutions in in general right and and of course that includes you know guiding our customers throughout their observability adoption journey and yeah uh very excited to be here um hopefully that I can provide some some uh some of my uh experience and and that would help uh you uh providing some insights to you. Yeah, thank you. Hello, I am Naan. I head up the observability at Standard Charted Bank. Um we are a huge bank and uh we provide banking services across private banking, retail banking, investment banking, etc., etc. Um I lead a team of passionate engineers who who love building observability for the end user and they believe in co-sharing of obserability across our end users. Uh so I'm here today to share about my experiences what are the pitfalls to build a huge obserability platform for a huge bank and uh what are the best practices that we all can reuse and learn from you guys as well. Great. Thanks. So let's start with the first one for you Nan. So from your perspective in standard charter bank why is obsibility important for you and of course you could share more bit like what are the challenges you've seen observing creating of possibility from where you were before to where you are now that would be great for all of us. So I think observability uh is a very important um element in our overall uh business vehicle. Um not just from a technology perspective or infrastructure perspective more of uh how our clients work uh with us or how we get the business from our clients. Uh we do do uh we do use uh obsibility across various business services. So just to give you a context, we have around uh uh 1,800 banking applications in the bank and uh uh which are across 65 data centers, major cloud providers, AWS, Azure, etc., etc. So the obserility plays a very crucial role for any um uh proactive uh incident management or uh or a major incident or infrastructure outage and then enabling our client experiencing and uh uh ensuring we are always on for our clients because when you're sitting in front of a client or a private uh wealth uh customer what you want last is that your RMS app goes on right so I think that's the experience that obserility uh platform does for the entire bank and uh we have around um 8,000 engineers uh developer s etc etc in the bank who uses uh obsibility platform in their own way and how they uh how they build the right set of uh obsibility together with the experience I think that's that's uh that's one thing that uh we have achieved so far and we are still on the journey. Um I think the key barriers and challenges that I would say is right few years back when we started this journey um we were pretty much uh uh using like uh 64 different monitoring and observability tools across the bank and uh uh there was a there was a there was a everyone was doing on their own and uh everyone had some were very advanced some were very low and some were somewhere in the middle. And one of the key things that we figured out was uh um it we we lacked entire transparency of the state and uh common patterns across the platforms. For example, our applications which were there on cloud, on prem, different local data centers, they couldn't observe the same things in the same way. like for them their service was the same name and the methods were same but they had different dashboards there different alerts to go to so I think that's that's where we started from um I won't say all the 65 uh are gone uh there are still some which are still there uh we are still working on a consolidation but uh um uh overall as a journey uh we are far beyond now in last 2 and a half is we moved very fast and uh we uh we provided a sort of uh a single uh uh pane of uh glass plus uh um plus more of a automated uh observability patterns for our end users to consume and bringing the same page for the different personas like developer and sRes as well as the uh delivery heads and managers. is giving them the same sort of pains. Uh that's what brings the obserability together. Over 60 monitoring tools. That's crazy level of silos. And the the funny thing is that all these 65 monitoring tools are not like exclusive. Sometimes one application use like four or five. So I found out an application which was using it's one of our banking services for our retail clients and that application used around 22 of them spanning from cloud to onrem and and and yeah everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. So if I may just another thing this is right. So sometimes in a in a um technology organization people focus on uh what are the feature of the tool that I use or how many tools do I have? Can I do consolidation because I want to save money and this is all good but the focus is really to be able to get visibility because what you want is your system to be up right and you want to detect signals early enough so you can do preemptive actions so you don't end up in in an incident. So having all the tools that makes incidents easy and manage and do search and do uh root cause analysis it's good but your goal is not to get to an incident right so yeah it's it's like one of the thing of course when there's so many tools everybody talks a different languages I mean we all working on the same company you achieve one thing making revenue for the business but when things goes crazy everybody speak one language everyone speak another language and when problem comes that's where yeah I can also relate to that, right? So, uh some of our customer they sh even sharing all these tools. So, sometimes one incident happens, right? Everything pops up, right? Then it's very confusing. They don't know where to look and they probably be looking at the wrong thing at the wrong wrong time as well, right? So, proing that one centralized um plane of glass that you mentioned is really really really the key and really help them to reduce a lot of those operation overhead. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So on on that topic right I think for Elyio and Jun Hong from your perspective here how does you see the obserability relate to where people now still on the journey to the cloud um as a platform as well but do you see anything around that any kind of trends? Yeah. So um because I mean for for we focus more on like for example cloud migrations and stuff right of course there are few key um soal metrics that uh the customer trying to achieve right um downtime right increase performance and at the same time uh must be cost efficiency right so other than that um I would say the uh observability tools especially very useful during the migration ation process, right? That provides them a a very um so-called um consolidated view, right, of what is not being migrated and what is already migrated, right? Keep keeping track of the progress, the inventory and at the same time provide that um dependency mapping as well, right? That's very key in um migrations, right? And I think one of the biggest bonus is that they can see in firsthand how the different performance they have uh when after migrating to cloud as well right because a lot of time uh while migrating to cloud uh we will be also looking at modernization optimizations right so they get to see it firsthand the different the different and uh that always you know help to propel the project uh move forward. Yeah. So your question was what do we see in customers as they go in their journey correct to the cloud right correct how does the obsibility relate right um so from our point of view there like two main things the first one is what um uh um Nan said is consolidation right of course it's very hard to get like a single pane of glass for real but you want a tool that is flexible enough to say well I have some stuff in the cloud I have some stuff on uh on prem. I have some stuff in like a SAS application for instance and you want to be able to um observe how all these uh things interact together and sometimes is easy collect log and metrics um you don't just want to observe sometimes you want to apply things right uh you want to uh make sure that patching or like latest version is is the same so you want some tools that allows you not just to observe but also to operate on that right so uh this is the first first thing and consolidation is is a big thing. Of course, you don't want to overdo, but um so you need certain primitives, right? Um so so that's the the first thing that that's um um that we saw. Um another thing um uh if I may is uh uh is more about practice, right? So when people start in their observability journey, sometimes the goal is, oh, I have this fantastic tool, I have all these metrics that come in, I'm going to create all the alerts, right? And and I I was telling him earlier uh the one team came to them and said, "Oh, we have like uh what's that 10,000 21,000 21,000 alerts." And we're like, "Hm, congratulations. How are you acting on all these 10,000 alerts that fires every day, right?" So to to your point, what we see is that there's this like big enthusiasm with the tool at the beginning and then um the second step and the hardest is to be the practice around that, right? So is it's good to have visibility on what your system is doing. Then what are you going to do about that? How are you going to react to these alerts? Um are you going to seeing the same alerts fighting every day, right? How are you removing the the root cause of this of this thing? So that's as a practice more than a tool adoption. Uh and that's the most complicated thing is is what we see people are spending most of the time on. Yeah. there's the culture change that the organization the team essentially need to pick up as well right there's this now there's one thing that you mentioned just now before that previously like this looking back couple of years ago there's a different tools owned by different teams and now uh things has changed can you talk to us more about how do you operate your opportunity team now who is involved especially of course for the practitioner here how do you guys even collaborate with many different stakeholders. So very interesting. I think one thing when I was building this team I I made sure is that we have people from different uh teams, different uh business domains and not just uh somebody picked up from the uh those custodians of tools to build this team. So um I think the the the organization barrier is a is a huge uh if especially when you have to uh change the mindset and the people's thought process how they use different tools and getting them onto a single um single obserility platform. U for me when I built this team uh few things that I ensured is that whatever was working right uh is being reused. Uh that's one thing. The other thing was um we as a team had a vision to use more um your most more products which are less vendor lockins and more open telemetry uh type of skill sets. So when we built this team, we looked around in the organization and and you will find people who would naturally fall for it like who love the space of for example one of our graphaname who works very closely with Alfredo. Uh he he came out of the blue and said I love this observability stuff. I love open telemetry. I love graphana. I love elastic etc etc. and uh he came back and said can I can I get a job in your team and uh I I don't care where I'm sitting but I think I can contribute a lot on this team. the the to overcome the barriers I think what we do is we do every week uh training sessions uh across the organization and uh some of these training sessions uh we usually have Q&A type of people sometimes like 30 minutes is a Q&A rapid fire type of rounds and then uh uh the first 30 minutes is what we are rolling out new what is new what is new feature etc etc that you can use what is the automated templ template just to configure on your uh onrem Kubernetes or on EKS, AKS wherever you want to do it. Um I think the uh other part that we do is uh we believe uh uh we we have created the learning pathways in the organization. So we have launched the trainings with our internal training academy and uh uh so we have a specialized course on how to get your uh uh dashboard up and running together with the alerts uh uh within 5 minutes kind of thing. How to reuse the panel libraries for Kubernetes then how to reuse the panel libraries for your u monolith apps or for microservices etc. Um other than that I think uh finding the right set of individuals who have the same mindset as what you are towards uh is not easy. Uh some people will join some people may not join and then some will left in middle of the uh journey. So we we got attritions as well because uh you are trying to explain to a an audience who is very used to how they do use their certain monitoring tool and or or how they do some special obsibility for their special projects and then uh you end up getting a lot of bashings around the organization that oh uh I can't use uh this platform I can't do this because I I love my thing right So you got to have a lot of resiliency as well in your uh it's more of a human resilience. You have to have that. Um how do you how do you foster that culture of learning and we have some sort of uh uh scoring as well like uh we have a game uh game type of where we score people who do a better log uh logging. Uh we score people who we penalize people. I was just telling him about it. We penalize people who uh who write uh some shitty logs into their logs like could not connect to unknown. I I remember this for this week. There's this team who writes this u log message called could not connect to unknown. And when we uh when we looked at the entire platform they they sent huge amount of log message saying could not connect to unknown and we had to literally uh put it on our Kafka and drop it every time we encounter such of messages. So yeah, I think uh building the the team is a bit of challenge uh but finding the right mindset and uh running the right side of uh training and learning culture is very important to overcome these barriers. On on this topic I think one thing that you mentioned that picked um my interest is number one is that of course resistant to change is human nature generally right. Another thing that you point out is where you intentionally choose tools that talk openly where the open telemetry comes in on on this area will there be when it comes to like criteria this could be of course like choosing the tools choosing the platform choosing the even like vendors you work with apart from this is that kind of like some of the top three area that you'll be looking at for I think um so one when we did the RFP across those 65 tools that we had um two three things that we looked at. So as you said uh open telemetry compliant and vendor neutral and the second thing was we looked at uh u the organization usage. uh we found out that uh graphfana as a dashboard uh and uh elastic as a uh skill set was very popular in the organization and uh 65% of the engineering community knew it. So it was very easy to go for a uh selection of couple of products across the organization. And uh uh the third one was the of course the cost because uh the cost when it comes to observability cost can really go very high and some of my AWS friends know about how do I pay my AWS bills. So um the uh the cost is the third thing that we look after that uh how do we uh how do we keep our TCO less across the organization uh for the entire set of obserability and monitoring tools that we use. So those are the three key criterias. Apart from that, if you look at all those 58, every one of them will have a special uh niche thing that they built for themselves. But that can be replicated using some REST APIs as he said in his presentation that can be replicated through some of the SNMP patterns or things like that. I think that's what we aim to do. Right. If I take my AWS hats off for a second and put before AWS hats off, one thing that was working very well in getting adoption was uh uh the fact that some tools needs to be self-service, right? To to his point, you create a dashboard, but every single one of those dashboard is editable. So there's an edit button next to pie chart or a diagram say, well, show me the the the query. Can I can I tinkle with the query? Can I can I do it? And and to the point that um when we were implementing this in in my role before um a lot of uh product managers and and business users so-cal um they were using um graphana in that case um to do like dashboarding related to you know progress of like ongoing tickets or uh ongoing chat for support. So stuff like that, right? And and they didn't actually have access to um the database for the tickets in particular. They were just having access to uh an event stream of uh every time this uh you know uh create a new chat or this like send message API were invoked, right? So again, it was not the actual data, it was like a proxy uh technical u data events, but it was easier for them to just self-s serve their requirements using the tech technical observability tool rather than the tool that they were using in this case was a it was a customer support tool, right? So the fact that those tools are accessible, you had the data and you can figure out how to use it on your own was like a super super super um driver of adoption. It was changing the mindset, right? Yeah. Sorry, just to add on, right? So um I think yeah, of course, you know, the the two gentleman's here have shared very very good points, right? But I think just to add on as from a SIS perspective, right? uh when we choose the tools with the customer, I think other than you know like flexibilities and cost right um one of the key things that um we really love Graphana is also the amount of um supported integrations and yet providing the flexibilities to do customizations for a lot of uh special use cases. So I think this is one of the strong point um where we see success uh with customer adopting um graphana especially in a highly distributed very complex um um um so-called system um this uh really works very well. Yeah. I think the data sources that Graphfana provides I I don't think anybody else provides. So yeah kudos to you. Thank you. That's why Grafana is Grafana. So um I have one questions but after this then we'll open the floor for the Q&A. So for the audience if you have any questions you can prep the questions now but before that for our panelists here when it comes to observability trend where do you see this will change as of course things will come in there the whole thing with the AI bubbles people are saying now arguably I think there crypto bubbles floating around somewhere um of course business will change right where do you anticipate this obsibility trend will be in coming years. Uh for me, I think there are a few points that I think just now the Anthony has shared, right? I'm very excited um in seeing the fin ops auto instrumentations. I think that will be the next big thing, right? Um and uh and on top of that that u me personally I'm seeing a lot of these new use cases where uh I mean how is code called it is like AI ops right? So other than just you know monitoring alerting and provide variable insights um actionable insights actually and we are also looking a lot of customer is also looking at automate that remediations so you actually complete the whole cycles and I think that's really exciting right um yeah so this is where I really look forward and um and I I think that is the next uh big things for observabilities thanks I think Um as you highlighted um uh in the obserability space I do really see um AI offs uh and anomaly detection going much uh beyond uh across the organizations and uh uh the uh the genai integrations uh which will make the ease of u together with some of the popular ML algorithms which will make the ease of writing and finding the root cause analysis. Uh that will that will be a significant uh uplift in this space. And uh lastly I would say um the remediation part which is more of a agentic AI as people call the buzzwords but uh essentially uh getting the early detection and then uh quickly remediating the anomalies which are very uh common. uh I think that's that's something which uh which is going to be a a good space to where observability will trend towards. I I I think I'll be boring and say Jennai. Um to his point that there's a lot of uh small operational um improvements that you can do uh even before you do root cause analysis or the graphana thing that they were showing with generating the the the postmortem. Um we release a couple of services and features at reinvent that help you in the moment in the incident and you know when alerts fire we create an autom an operational investigation and there's a model that's already looking at the logs. So you know the time it takes you to get your alert and log into your laptop and and get some coffee maybe because it's late night models are already doing the initial um gathering uh and investigation for you. So when you start looking at the issue um you already have like a an idea where to look. So I think that these things are are really useful and why they're useful because they help you reduce the time it takes you to um restore the service and that basically result into um customer better customer experience right so again in Amazon we always do something which is we work back from the customer outcome that we want to have. So all the tooling is cool. Um all the genai is cool but that's that's the goal right? Yeah think faster resolution essentially I think making every engineers uh super engineers so there's no everybody has a very powerful tools that allows them to essentially figure out quickly and I think correlation part as he mentioned right the tools doing correlation before even engineer looks at that thing. Yeah that's that's going to be a big thing. Totally.
