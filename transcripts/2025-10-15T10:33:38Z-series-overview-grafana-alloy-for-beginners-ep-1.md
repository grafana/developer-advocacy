## Summary

In the introductory video of the "Grafana Alloy for Beginners" series, hosted by Lisa Jung, a Staff Developer Advocate at Grafana, and later joined by Senior Software Engineer Mischa Thompson, viewers are guided through the objectives of the series. The four-part series aims to teach the fundamentals of Alloy, its application in infrastructure and application observability, and includes hands-on exercises to reinforce learning. Key topics include configuring Alloy to collect and process telemetry data, utilizing Alloy for both infrastructure and application observability, and practical exercises such as navigating the Alloy UI and managing data attributes. Viewers are encouraged to access the series repository and documentation for additional resources as they progress through the series.

# Grafana Alloy for Beginners Series

Hi! Welcome to the Grafana Alloy for Beginners series. I'm **Lisa Jung**, a Staff Developer Advocate here at Grafana. Joining us later is **Mischa Thompson**, a Senior Software Engineer. We are both from Grafana Labs, and we co-created this series to help you get up and running with Alloy.

The series is made up of four parts:
1. **Alloy Fundamentals**: We’ll start with what Alloy is and how it works.
2. **Infrastructure and Application Observability**: We’ll dive into how to use Alloy for both infrastructure and application observability.
3. **Hands-On Exercises**: Finally, we’ll wrap it all up with some hands-on exercises to put your skills to the test.

We'll kick things off with **Alloy 101**, where we'll break down what Alloy is and when it makes sense to use it. Next, we’ll learn how to configure Alloy to collect, process, and export telemetry data. 

As mentioned earlier, Alloy is versatile; it's great for both infrastructure and application observability.

### Infrastructure Observability
For infrastructure observability, we'll use Alloy to:
- Collect logs and metrics from our infrastructure.
- Configure Alloy to process and export data to target observability backends.
- Use the Alloy UI to verify that the pipeline is running smoothly end to end.

### Application Observability
For application observability, we’ll:
- Collect metrics, logs, and traces from our app.
- Process and export the data to the target observability backends.
- Learn how to generate logs from the traces we’ve collected.

### Hands-On Exercises
We will finish strong with four hands-on exercises designed to reflect real-world tasks, including:
- Navigating the Alloy UI to find target info.
- Dropping high cardinality labels.
- Standardizing attributes across our data.
- Redacting sensitive information.

### Resources
There are two main resources you want to keep handy throughout the series:
- **Series Repo**: Packed with everything we'll cover, including slides and the learning environment.
- **Alloy Documentation**: Your go-to for all the details.

You’ll find links to both in the description below. Make sure to have the repo open as you follow along so you don’t miss a thing.

Alright, we’ve just provided an overview of what’s in store for you. In the next episode, we’ll dive into what Alloy is and explore when it makes the most sense to use it. 

Thanks for watching! I’ll see you in the next one.

Hi. Welcome to the Grafana Alloy for Beginner 
series. I'm Lisa Jung, a Staff Developer Advocate here at Grafana. Joining us later is Mischa 
Thompson, a Senior Software Engineer. We're both from Grafana Labs and we co-created the series 
to help you get up and running with Alloy. The series is made up of four parts. We'll start with 
the fundamentals of Alloy, what it is and how it works. Then we'll dive into how to use Alloy for 
both infrastructure and application observability. And finally, we'll wrap it all up with some 
hands-on exercises to put your skills to the test. We'll kick things off with Alloy 101, where we'll 
break down what Alloy is and when it makes sense to use it. Next, we'll learn how to configure 
Alloy to collect, process, and export telemetry data. And like we mentioned earlier, Alloy 
isn't just for one thing. It's great for both infrastructure and application observability.
For infrastructure observability, we'll use Alloy to collect logs and metrics from 
our infrastructure. Once we got the data, we'll configure Alloy to process and export 
data to target observability backends. Then we'll use the Alloy UI to verify the pipeline 
is running smoothly end to end. For application observability, we'll use Alloy to collect metrics, 
logs, and traces from our app. Then we'll process and export the data to the target observability 
backends. We'll also learn how to generate logs from the traces we've collected. Now, we'll 
finish is strong with four hands-on exercises to put your new Alloy skills to the test. These 
are designed to reflect real world tasks like navigating the Alloy UI to find target info, 
dropping high cardinality labels, standardizing attributes across our data and redacting sensitive 
information. There are two main resources you want to keep handy throughout the series. First, the 
series repo is packed with everything we'll cover, including slides and the learning environment. 
Second, the Alloy documentation is your go-to for all the details. You'll find links to both 
in the description below. Make sure to have the repo open as you follow along so you don't miss 
a thing. Alright, we've just got an overview of what's in store for you. In the next episode, 
we'll dive into what Alloy is and explore when it makes the most sense to use it. Thanks for 
watching. I'll see you in the next one.
