Transcript: But can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, that's important. Hi, my name is I'm solutions engineer with Labs. Um I'm part of the Prometheus team and I have the honor to moderate today's panel discussion. And with that, I'm just going to get started. Um today we're diving into the quickly evolving world of observability. How organizations are scaling um their strategies, managing governance and balancing the innovation with the reliability. Joining us today are Kenan. He's a partner sales solution architect at AWS. Brings expertise in cloud native observability and also platform scalability. Try my last name. Try my last name. Yeah, that's okay. And and also we have Julian. Um he's a director partner manager at PCG.io and observability partner specializing in helping companies develop and grow their cloud strategy. So let's get started to set the stage. Can each of you describe the observability strategy and how graphana fits into it? What's the primary drivers? Reliability, cost standardization or something else. Who wants to get started? Sure. We just take Julian. I can I can start. Um yeah, I mean first and foremost I think in the observability field the functionality is the most important thing. the the tool that you use needs to give you the the results that you need. But what we hear from customers, what is driving them is two two major things. Cost reductions and the reduction of of operational overhead. So they they want to use tools and not build them up and manage them and make sure that they're running properly. They just want to use them. um and the employees want to basically help the business drive the future things and not maintain what has happened or what has been used in the past. So, so these two drivers really are things that bring our customers often to to Graphfana cloud because we we see on premise they have the the self-hosted Graphana stacks and they like the tool um at the same time they don't want to have all the efforts of managing that in the cloud. So we propose to them that Graphana cloud is a good solution and um yeah compared to alternatives often the price then wins the the conversation because functionality is similar reliability is amazing and and yeah then the price is the deal breaker for the other tools. Yeah. That being said Graphana Claus mostly does the get the reliability from our partner AWS. So Kan um what are your stance on on the question? Okay, looks like I'm the only guy I'm the only representative from uh major cloud hyperscalers from AWS. Thank you. Uh you mentioned a couple of things. So the second one being drivers. Let me start with drivers. So when c well what do I do? I'm a partner solution architect at AWS. I uh I talk customers uh about you know customers come to me. They explain their challenges. I have a talk to them about the observability strategy. you know for the some of the challenges what you know should you use managed services should you go go for one of the ISVS that are out there and the things that I keep hearing uh most often when it comes to drivers for observability ISV ISV independent software vendors adoption uh one one being meanantime to resolution uh taking the uh insights of you know the three pillars of observability your metrics logs and traces so the customers want reduce the meanantime to resolution, figure out what the problem is and ultimately uh being able to reduce it. Another way is you know to get enough data to be able to make datadriven decisions about uh datadriven decisions about uh optimizing their infrastructure and respective costs in the cloud would be another one. Another popular topic is of course you know if they have observability usually you know sometimes they don't have observability if they have they're not there's no centralized way of approaching observability so they come to me and say yeah we need a centralized way we need a unified way a procedure or how are we going to tackle observability and then finally you know if you have EC2 instances and stuff like that that's easy to observe everybody can do it we have our managed to do it. But once you start talking about uh complex infrastructures, once you start talking about uh cloud, a lot of our multicloud approach, they have multiple cloud some data centers involved on premise infrastructure involved. So in that case they also want to uh uh be able to uh uh observe these uh using a single observability solution. So those are some of the key drivers that we keep seeing at the AWS. Cool. Thanks Kan. um as we see it and as I'm part of the pre-sales team I also see things like that many companies that's struggling with structuring observability responsibilities like we had questions in the talk before about how do you do this and that when you have multiple stacks running how do you aggregate or segregate data um what government models have you seen work the best is it like a centralized approach distributed ownerships or maybe something hbrid that you have any tips on how to balance accountability without creating typical bottlenecks. Should we go ahead with Julian as well? Sure. Um, yeah, I mean we are also a managed service provider. So, so some of the solutions we build for customers, we we manage them and operate them after we hand them over to the customer. And our limit is basically the infra the end of the infrastructure layer where the operating system goes towards the application. And we often end up with with hybrid setups in terms of observability where we observe the infrastructure and and everything there. And customers then observe their own application because they know their applications better than us. And we um make sure that the infrastructure is performing the way it should be. And that works most of the cases quite well for us. But it needs to be clear that it's one unified dashboard so that even in order there's something going on, we can help them troubleshoot or vice versa that we find the the origin or the root cause of the problem as soon as possible because that's what these tools are made for. I find that uh you mentioned a couple of things here. I find that fed pro approach works best for observability because on one hand you want to have a centralized strategy when talking about observability that's set uh you know from a central team in your company but you also want to give each team enough freedom to own the dashboards that they create and the uh respective alarms that go with the uh that go with the uh uh dashboards. Uh something that we see worked is of course role based access uh because you don't want everybody to have access to all the data. It should be on a need to know basis. Uh else is uh you know create dashboards that are you know for your popular services within your company and then of course uh you should have a way to do best practice sharing across team boundaries. you know, if there's one if there's a one best practice, have a have have a way have a procedures for other teams to find out and uh uh uh work together on this. And then of course, I think this was mentioned by some uh one of the other speakers have uh buy in and not just from your developers and your operations teams, you should also have u uh buy in from uh business teams as well. And something that's very important and I think you should you know look at your teams within your company and then for each team pick an observability champion somebody who's passionate about data I say pick somebody who's passionate about observability but obser observability in essence is data uh the fundamental you know you collect a bunch of data and then you build software on top of it to make out of it uh pick somebody who's passionate about data and have them drive the initiative with within their team. So it doesn't fizzle out. If you don't get people to take ownership of observability, everybody owns it, but nobody really does. And then it just kind of fizzles out with time. Having that one person that drives it, that stays on top of it tends to produce results. I agree with that. And what one thing that we do usually with customers in our managed service to to to get this ownership and and and the cross relation to business is we try to also monitor business metrics and and and kind of make like try try to put them in relation to the the technical metrics so that we know how many clicks per dollar spent or how what's the CPU usage of of of of something for each dollar that we create and so on. And by that by seeing metrics in a different form with other information, we find business owners tend to get more engaged in that topic and they yeah own it more. And what I find interesting is you mentioned something it's important to know what you want to do because it happens once in a while that we customers tell us they have amazing dashboards, amazing um observability and then we ask what happens when when the metric crosses the threshold and like nothing. We have an outage somewhere like why didn't you put an alarm that you that you get alerted when when the threshold is reached like ah we never thought of it. So yeah, I think monitoring is in the end it's a tool but you need to know what you want to achieve with the tool and it's not just it doesn't fulfill its purpose by existing. It should definitely go back from the business. You should always start with the question monitoring. I see a lot of people you know they gather all this data and then okay now you're observing all this data. What are you trying to achieve with it? And and they use one dashboard they have a million dashboards but they is it answering any questions? Is it but yeah maybe well it's an excellent uh conversation that I don't want to interrupt but um getting to the point that you have this thousands of dashboards and you're really using just one uh one of the questions um that I prepared today is with so much data that we have available now in all the systems that we're collecting and what are the most meaningful metrics and KPIs to check for for example change management continuous improvement of your observability you have any any ideas on that will it fit dashboard to to be honest that's it goes a bit too too much in in the technical perspective for me maybe uh Kenan can can take on some of that so your question was what what are some of the most meaningful KPIs that uh yeah exactly the meaningful KPIs that you can can have for for track the most effective KPIs are the ones that uh tie in whatever is happening with your infrastructure, with your customer experience, how does it affect in the business context, how does it affect your customer conversion rates, how does it affect your customer uh satisfaction on your uh on your cloud. So I think those are the metrics that are really important. Uh yeah relating the technical parts to the business part so that if if something changes in one you you see it also in the other and you with metrics you should you know figure out you know some a customer when I say a customer it doesn't has have to necessarily be a customer paying customer a customer in a retail business a customer that's using your API whatever so focus on your customer's journey and then track the metrics that are going to improve that journey that are going to support that journey from your customer. So what is it? What is their journey? What's the important parts of the journey? And then collect all the metrics that are going to support and make the journey better for your customer. So those are the most effective relevant metrics uh that you can uh collect. not the, you know, the CPU, the memory usage, the latency, the errors, that's all good, but if it doesn't, you know, your customer is not going to see any of that. Your customer only has the experience and whatever. That's what they see. They don't see what's going on in the background. So, go back from your customer, figure out what is it that they uh care about, and then get the metrics to support that and improve that uh customer journey. Yes. find out the technical metrics that support the business metrics and make sure that they move in the same way. And so if something happens between that ratio, then there's probably a problem in the system somewhere or something has changed in the in the customer behavior. But but yeah, we we try to see observability now in a more modern way of relating it to the business because CPU usage is nice. It's nice to see and it's important to see in order to make sure that the system works properly. But in the end, you want to know how does it impact my business and how can we use these metrics to make our business better. Exactly. Then then just making sure that that the CPUs are in a good good window. Yeah. Okay. One of the last questions for for for the panel is do you have any any advice to organizations that are looking to strengthen their observability strategy? when you have one one advice that you could give them, what would it be for for an organization that wants to improve observability besides what we've already seen from GA and uh and uh so I I used to work for AWS so I'm afraid that our answer might be very similar but I I always say start from the back think about what you want to achieve and work backwards from there and and yeah go with your observability beyond ond just technical things mix in the business critical measures of of how your business works and then try to relate them in a way that you know when these metrics move also the business will move one of the most I said you know one of the most most important tips that I can give to our customers you know it's a I think we I'm going to reiterate on it we talked about this a little bit before start with the questions start with a question and then work backwards from the question in AWS we have a lot of you probably know this we have dashboards on top of dashboards on top of dashboards but none of them just started off well let's just track it for the hell of tracking it was always what question what need what questions am I trying to answer by building this dashboard and with the durability I think you should do the same thing we have a you know I see a lot of teams that drown in data all the mentioned this before they have all the data but they're not getting any insights out of it and it's not helping them to make any actions out of all that data that they're collecting. So always start from the question and then go through the uh uh through this process of collecting metrics to help you answer that question. And something else when you look at observability tools something very important you know on paper you know you have your dino traces your data dogs your llungs your relics on a paper they have a lot of features but and you see it's complex you can do everything and anything you can do you know possible with it but a most the most complex tool is not necessarily the best tool it's the one that's going to provide you the data that you need to take actionable insights and continuous used to improve uh having that data. So yeah, don't build dashboards for the sake of having dashboards. Have them have purpose and and make sense. Okay,
