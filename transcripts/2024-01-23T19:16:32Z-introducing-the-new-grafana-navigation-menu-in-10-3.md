Transcript: Hi, my name is Laura and I'm part of the
Frontend Platform Team at Grafana Labs. I would like to present to you the
improved design of our navigation, which is available in the
latest Grafana version. After releasing the first version of our
new navigation menu in the beginning of this year, we gathered plenty of feedback and
implemented some improvements to make your life easier. The new design shows all three
levels of navigation items at once, in a more compact
navigation menu. Therefore, it provides a better overview. We also improved the structure
and introduced new sections like infrastructure, application, and frontend. In its initial state, the navigation
menu is overlaying the page, but it can be easily docked for
keeping it open permanently, which makes it easy to navigate. And see your content as well. If you are focused on one task
like building a dashboard, you can also collapse it. We hope you enjoy the new view and
behavior of our navigation menu, and thanks a lot for listening.
