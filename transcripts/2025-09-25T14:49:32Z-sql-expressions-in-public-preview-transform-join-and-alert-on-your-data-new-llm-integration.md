## Summary

In this video, Kyle Brandt, a Staff Engineer at Grafana Labs, introduces the public preview of SQL Expressions with the release of Grafana 12.2, scheduled for September 23, 2025. He highlights several new features, including an integration with a large language model (LLM) that can suggest queries based on users' data sources, optimize existing queries for better performance, and explain the purpose of queries for easier understanding. Additionally, enhancements to the editor include expanded editing space, automatic formatting, shortcuts for running and copying queries, and auto-completion features. Brandt encourages viewers to provide feedback on these updates.

# SQL Expressions Public Preview Announcement

Hello, I'm **Kyle Brandt**, a Staff Engineer here at **Grafana Labs**. I'm excited to share that **SQL Expressions** is entering public preview with the release of **Grafana 12.2** on **September 23rd, 2025**. 

## What's New in SQL Expressions

One of the features I'm particularly excited about is the new **LLM integration** directly in the editor. This integration allows the LLM to analyze your data source queries and the results they return. Based on this analysis, it can suggest a query you might write and insert it directly into the editor for you to run.

Additionally, if you already have an existing query, the LLM can review it for potential performance improvements and suggest insights you might not have considered before. These enhancements can also be applied and executed directly in the editor.

If you didn't write the query or don't remember it well, another helpful feature is the ability of the LLM to explain the query to you. It breaks down the SQL and attempts to clarify the objective of the query.

## Editor Improvements

It's not just about AI and LLM; we've also made significant improvements to the editor itself. You can now expand the editor to have more room for larger queries. 

Other enhancements include:
- **Automatic formatting**
- **Shortcuts** to run and copy your queries
- **Auto-complete** functionality

Thank you for taking the time to explore these features. We look forward to your feedback!

Hello, I'm Kyle Brandt, a Staff
Engineer here at Grafana Labs. I'm excited to share that SQL Expressions
is entering public preview with the release of Grafana 12.2. That is on September 23rd, 2025. So let's have a look at
what's new in SQL Expressions. One of the things I really like is the
new LLM integration that's directly in the editor. The LLM can look at your data source
queries and what's returned from them and suggest a query you might write and
then put that in the editor and you can run it. Additionally, if
you have an existing query, the LLM can take a look at that and
look for possible performance logic improvements, maybe insights that you could add
that you hadn't considered before, and that also can be applied
and run directly in the editor. If you did not write the query
or maybe don't remember it that well, another feature is that it can take a
look at the query and try to explain it to you. So it takes a look at the
SQL and breaks that down for you, and also tries to figure out what
the objective of the query is. It's not just AI and LLM. We've also improved to the editor
itself so you can expand it so you have more room to edit larger queries.
We've added automatic formatting, we've also added shortcuts
to run and copy your queries, and we've added auto complete as well. So I want to thank you for
looking at this feature. We look forward to your
feedback. Thank you.
