Transcript: The day's finally here! We are the three co-chairs
for this conference. I've got Carl here, RichiH, and
I'm Michaela, and we're very excited to get to see everyone
in Seattle for GrafanaCON 2025. It's a packed venue and
it's really exciting. There's a lot of movement, so we
can't wait to show you around. So let's get you backstage. So now we're backstage. This is where all the AV team
and all of the preparations happen before each session. So this is Mat Ryer, our host. And our AV team, marketing
team, everything is here. And here you can see the stage. People are gathering up, but there
are no presentations right now. Really like this
atmosphere of this theater. Creates a certain vibe that
other tech conferences don't get. Now let's go into the science fair. The science fair is one of our
experiments this time where we want to show all the weird and wonderful
ways of how you can use Grafana. We also have 10 sensors
spread around the venue. Where you can see live relative
humidity and temperature and air pressure, and we have a dashboard. We can see everything. And here is our Ask the Experts booth. You'll see a lot of experts placed
around, with a variety of understanding of the open source projects that we have. Here ready to help, really. So this is where it all started
for everyone this morning. There's of course a lot going on. We have a lot of help around the venue,
and it's just really exciting to be here. Honestly, we wish everyone from
the community could join us here. So bye from Seattle, and we
hope to see you next year.
