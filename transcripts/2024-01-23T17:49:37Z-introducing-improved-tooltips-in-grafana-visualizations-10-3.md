Transcript: Hi, my name is Adela Almasan, and I'm an engineer
on the DataViz Squad at Grafana Labs. Today, I'm excited to announce that we're
working on improving tooltips across all visualizations. We are unifying the tooltip architecture to
provide a more consistent user experience across Grafana. Besides the overall improved performance,
our new tooltips are packed with features like color indicators, time uniformity, improved
support for long labels, refreshed examplar's tooltip, and support for all mode in more
visualizations. This is just the beginning. With the unified architecture, we hope to
make tooltips more powerful and useful over time, across all visualizations. So far, the new tooltips have been implemented
in Time Series, Candlestick, Trend, Heat Maps, Status History, State Timeline, and XY Chart. As this is an ongoing project, we are still
working on improving the dashboard shared crosshair and annotation support. We anticipate support for these features will
be released soon. To try out the new tooltips experience, you
can enable the 'newVizTooltips' feature toggle. We appreciate any feedback you might have
and stay tuned for more support in visualizations soon. Thanks from the DataViz Squad at Grafana.
