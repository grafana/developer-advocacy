Transcript: Hello, my name is Vasil Kaftandzhiev, the PM for Cloud Provider
Observability in Grafana Cloud, and today I'm going to show
you our new visualization for Google Cloud Observability
and namely Cloud Run. This is one of our most
sophisticated views, yet it provides you with resource, thresholds and usage, right sizing entrance for both services and containers. From the landing page, you'll be able to visualize
any spikes in your CPU, memory usage, network traffic, and current active requests.
With a single click, you'll be able to drill
down into every service or container and visualize all of its
characteristics from active and idle containers, probe success, CPU, and memory usage. Additionally, the right sizing view provides
you with the top five services and containers that have highest CPU memory usage, highest startup times, max request concurrencies, and billable instances. The services tab and the containers
tab provide you this holistic view and drill-down capabilities so you
can troubleshoot with ease.
