## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses various resources available for seeking help with Grafana, an open-source analytics and monitoring platform. They mention the community forum and Slack channel as ongoing support options, as well as comprehensive documentation. The speaker emphasizes utilizing the repository labels in the Grafana GitHub repository to find specific issues related to different panel types and data sources. They suggest reviewing both open and closed issues, as these may contain valuable insights, developer discussions, and potential workarounds shared by users.

I'm just looking for other places to get help from. 

Here are a few options:

- **The Forum**: A great place to connect with others.
- **Slack**: I'm always in our Slack community.
- **Documentation**: Our documentation is super comprehensive.

If you need to dig in a little bit further, I recommend two things:

1. **Repository Labels**: In our Grafana repo, which contains the open source materials, we have labels for every type of panel and every type of data source. You can look for open or even closed issues that have the label corresponding to that panel type or data source type.
  
2. **Issue Tracking**: If it's an open issue, you might be able to see discussions from developers trying to diagnose or reproduce it. Many closed issues also provide insights where people have found workarounds, which are often shared in both open and closed issues.
