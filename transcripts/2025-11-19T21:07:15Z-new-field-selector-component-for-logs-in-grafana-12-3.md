I am Matias from the Observability Logs Squad, and I wanted to show you the new **Field Selector** for logs. 

This is a new component, part of the redesigned logs visualization. It displays a list of all the fields present in the logs, accompanied by a percentage indicating the amount of logs where each field is present. 

From here, you can toggle these fields as display fields, customize the order of display, and even include the log line body if you need it. This component is resizable, and you can also collapse it when you no longer need it.

We hope you find this helpful as part of our efforts to provide the best possible experience when you're looking at logs in Grafana. 

Thank you for listening!
