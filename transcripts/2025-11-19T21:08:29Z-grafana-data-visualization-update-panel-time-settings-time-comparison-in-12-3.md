## Summary

In this video, Drew Slobodnjak introduces a new feature for Grafana visualizations: the panel time settings drawer. This update allows users to access specific time settings for individual panels without needing to edit the entire dashboard. By enabling the panel time settings and time comparison feature toggles in the Grafana configuration, users can set a unique time range for each panel, apply time shifts, and compare two time ranges visually. This enhancement streamlines the process of performing time-based analyses, enabling users to gain insights more efficiently without duplicating panels or dashboards. Drew invites viewers to provide feedback on this new feature.

# Announcement of Panel Time Settings Drawer in Visualizations

Hi there! I'm Drew Slobodnjak. Today, on behalf of the dashboards and dataviz squads, I'm excited to announce the addition of the **panel time settings drawer** in visualizations.

With this feature, you can access key panel-specific time settings without editing the dashboard. **Please note** that to try out these new features, you must first enable the *panel time settings* and *time comparison* feature toggles in your Grafana configuration.

## Accessing the New Settings

To access these new settings, follow these steps:

1. Click the **panel menu**.
2. Select the **time settings** option.

The panel time settings drawer will appear, allowing you to:

- Set a panel-specific time range that overrides the dashboard time range.
- Apply a time shift relative to the current time range.
- Visualize a time comparison between two time ranges in your panel.

## Benefits of the Update

With this update, you can easily perform time-based comparative analyses in a single view, all within one panel. This allows you to rapidly gain insights into your data without the need to duplicate panels or dashboards for this type of analysis.

Thank you for watching, and we look forward to your feedback!
