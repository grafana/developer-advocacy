## Summary

In this video, Juan Cabanas, a Software Engineer at Grafana Labs, discusses the redesigned reporting feature introduced in Grafana 12.2, which became available for public preview on July 22, 2025. The update simplifies the report creation process by replacing the previous multi-step flow with a more intuitive single-page form. Juan demonstrates how to create a report directly from a dashboard, allowing users to maintain dashboard context and view a list of related reports. He highlights new functionalities, including the ability to download CSV files of table data and provides a brief overview of the scheduling process for reports. Viewers are encouraged to check the updated reporting documentation for more information.

Let's talk about the redesign of the reporting feature available in public preview in Grafana 12.2, released on July 22nd, 2025. I'm Juan Cabanas, a Software Engineer on the Sharing team at Grafana Labs.

With this redesign, we have made the report creation flow simpler and more intuitive. The previous multi-step flow is gone, and we have replaced it with a sectioned form so that the entire report is on a single page. You can now create reports directly from a dashboard while maintaining the dashboard context, and you can see a list of reports that include the current dashboard.

So, how does it work? Let me show you.

Once I have selected the dashboard from which I want to create a report, I click on **Share**, then **Schedule Report**, and the schedule report drawer opens. I click on **Create New Report**, and as you can see, most of these fields are filled out, but you can make any changes you like.

Now, regarding recipients, there is a menu from which you can download a CSV file of all the table partners, if there are any, view a general preview, download a PDF, or go to your organizational report settings.

Now I'm going to schedule the report. We are automatically taken back to the schedule report drawer, and now the report we just created is listed here.

And that's it! Check out the updated reporting docs to learn more and try it for yourself.
