Transcript: hello gra Fanatics ready for a journey through data Landscapes I mean literal data about Landscapes because we will review the geom map panel in grafana the ultimate tool for mapping insights we will explore how to visualize location based data and data driven discoveries often it is vital to pinpoint elements on a map like visualizing the data center locations monitoring where are your sales or to track disease outbreaks enter grafana geom map panel a powerful tool for such tasks but mapping data requires specific prerequisites let's explore what is needed to get up and running our geom map panel to display maps data requires location identification today for E we're going to use some CSV data the most common approach is having columns for latitude and longitude in their standard formats alternatively we can use a geohash colum for automatic identification last we can locate countries US states airports and many more using a column with their names or codes examples for this type of data are provided in the video description now eared with this knowledge let's create our first GE [Music] map we will use grafana plate to create our first geomap panel but the steps will work in a local grafana setup to access grafana Play Link in the corner the home screen is a dashboard where you can click the add button on top and select visualization to add a panel in the panel editor set the panel as geom map at the top right corner for ease we will use the test data data source to use our CSV for more information about the test data data source Link in the corner paste the CSV for the attitude and longitude and right away you will see circles in the map if the column titles are lat or latitude and longitude LNG or lawn locations will be automatically identified similarly it will automatically work with the geohash column CSV for other data sources ensure that your queries return data in these formats otherwise we will have to specify which column to use a little bit later and with that you have your first geom map for further customization and exploration let's dive deeper into geom map customizations the first customization that we will check is the base map layer it is the main map that the panel displays the default option will be already selected and it is the cartoon map but without any options but if we actually select the CTO you will you lots of options such as the dark mode toggling Place labels altering opacity and toggling Tool tips you can also also select other map providers like open Street XYZ tile and Arc GS which will give you lots of sof maps to choose from the map layer section is the most important as this panel shows data in tiers and inside of it you can customize data displays and much more now layer one is there by default but you can add rename order and remove layers here layer one's options show layer type where you have markers select Ed by default and display the circles that we see already hit map is the other layer type that will display your data there are other layer types like route photos and network but at the moment of making this video they are in beta versions more info with the link in the corner using markers or heat map we must select the query that provides Geo dat and select how it will be identified as mentioned we can identify those latitudes and longitudes or geohash columns automatically here we can also set the size of the marker the shape alignment colors opacity labels to display either fixed or from a column and much much more if we select the heat map we can only change the hotness indicators we can select a couple more like the geojson which allows you to pull maps from a file in grafana like countries airports or States you can also select day and night indicator given the current time the rests are are the map types that we saw earlier you can add multiple layers and have more Geo dat displayed you can even add a map on top of each other now in the map view section you can toggle tools like locations coordinates zooms continents or just to automatically fit data next on the map control section you can chuggle some controls scroll wheel zooms attributions scales measuring tools tool tips and even a B view now clicking on apply shows you a geomap panel in your dashboard where you can add many other panels that we have out there if you want to learn more about them check the videos in the screen but now you can go out and play with your new geom map panel happy dashboarding and have a good one
