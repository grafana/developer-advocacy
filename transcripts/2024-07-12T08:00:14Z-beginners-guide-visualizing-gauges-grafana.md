Transcript: hello graph Fanatics wish that your data could speak to you like a fuel gauge in a car just imagine instead of guessing if you are running low on coffee Supply or server capacity or speaking of coffee if the pot is overflowing you could see it instantly so in today's episode we'll show you how to use the gauge panels to make your dashboards clear like your car's fuel gauge with grafana gauge panel buckle up as we're about to [Music] begin G are single value visualizations that will repeat a gauge for every series column or row this makes them perfect for quickly assessing ke metrics at a glance whenever you're are tracking sever load monitoring sales targets or keeping an eye on network traffic GES give you a clear an immediate view of your data's Vital Signs so why don't we start creating want to explain these repetitions according to data and the customizations that we can do on them we will use grafana play to create our first gauge panel the steps will work as well in a local grafana setup to access grafana Play Link in the corner grafana place home screen is a dashboard here you can follow these steps to add a panel in the panel editor set the panel as gauge in the top right corner and that's it you have your first gauge panel in it you can quickly modify the title description transparency links and repeat options in the panel options for now we will just change the title to my first gauge pretty the data source here will be the last data source that I have used which is the random walk in the test data data source we will continue using the test data data source today for more information about it Link in the corner but for now I am not sure of uh what those numbers in the graph mean and you may even have an empty gauge so why don't we dive right into the data needs and possibilities for the gauge panel [Music] as mentioned earlier a gauge panel can paint a gauge for every series column or Row in your data it can paint every cell in the table returned by your query so to understand better down in this video's description is a set of csvs that we will use today so let's copy the first one and paste it in the test data data source selecting the CSV content the pasted data has two rows many numeric columns and one text column wow pasting it makes lots of gauges appear certainly for each column but you may have noticed a few things like that just the last row appears or that the text column is skipped or also that the column titles are automatically displayed why is that well we will look into those settings in a moment but back to the display data with this you can automatically display multiple readings at once another cool thing is that the panel automatically sets the Max and minimum values of the gauges from the highest and smallest returned by the query let's pick paste the next CSV set of values and check how they are displayed again all them are available in the video description copying the set labeled as just one you can see only one gauge cleaner and easier but the gauge meter is full well that is because it has only one value remember the panel detects Max and minimum values automatically from the queri data in cases like this you can use a setting that we will see in a moment to Define Max and minimum let's go for the next set of values the Max mean included data set from the CSV included in the description again once basted you have the value correctly displaying the gauge but you also have the Max and minimum values displayed not so cool right all these things are customizations so why don't we dive into them and clear up those questions such as why were only the last values on the bottom of the data displayed or where were the first ones or how to hide the Max and minimum values and much more so let's find out what this customizations are we already talked about the general panel options so let's move on to the value options here the first option is the show it allows us to change between displaying calculated or all the values let's start with the easiest all the values this tells the panel to display everything as you can tell the first row values have now appeared as well we have more options like the display limit in case you have too many gauge values and under it you can indicate if you want to display all the numeric values in the query all the fields even if they are not gauge like text here you can also select a given field to display this is useful again if you have a parameter defining Max and minimum but the displayed value is another one now the calculate display will have calculations by default you have last and that is why earlier the last row was the one being displayed here you can select to display maybe the first one the maximums averages and all sorts of calculations then similar to the all values you can Define What fields to focus on now the gauge options customize some gauge display settings such as the orientation of the display being automatic horizontal or vertical when you have multiple gauges but don't worry if you select horizontal and only text is visible just give the gauges a little bit more space and they will appear or we can use the options at the bottom to affect the size setting as manual you will get a slide bar where you can make them huge but okay let's keep them automatic in orientation and size you can also modify things such as displaying or not the thresholds and their labels and the last option is neutral which is a starting point for the gauges usually kept empty the next settings are very straightforward you can affect the text size of the titles under the gauges and the values inside of them straightforward personally I like them automatics let grafana do the work right now in the the standard options you can change things like the unit of the value being miles or kilometers or temperature Etc we have as well the minimum and maximum values in case you don't have them or want to pull them from the query data you can also Define them here again if left empty they are automatically defined from the values returned by your query speaking of automatic if you have a list of values per field you can turn on the field calculation to pull them from each field set of values and not from the whole returned table lastly you can set things like the number of decimals you want the title displayed under the gauge the color scheme and what to display when there are no values speaking of the color scheme gauge colors display depend on the thresholds that you define in the last tab of the settings clicking apply will display your new gauge panel which you can resize and move at wheel you can place the panel together with many other panels outou there if you want to learn more check the videos on screen but now you can create and customize gauge panels as usually let us know if you have any questions or comments leave them down below here happy dashboarding and have a good one
