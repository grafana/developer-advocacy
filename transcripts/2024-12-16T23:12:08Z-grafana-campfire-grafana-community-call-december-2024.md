Transcript: hello hello that got recorded yeah no that's that's what we're here for we're recording this right we're embracing the asynchronous nature of this um we don't care when this is recorded it'll be published on YouTube right um cool welcome everyone this is the first grafo Community call after twoyear Hiatus how are we all feeling pretty good pretty good that's yeah yeah so we'll be recording this and we'll also publish this on YouTube just in the normal Community call channels um we I think we also wanted to Rebrand this a bit here this call is going to be the Gana campfire where we'll talk about just all things grafana really sort of grafana grafana as we like to say grafana labs and also a bit of sort of engineering culture I feel like we can we can get we can fit both into this and if you're a fan of graan con I think this is for you also um all right and the new format maybe it's worth explaining uh we'll try to get the same group of hosts always going so it'll be uh myself David um then Carl and Matt and so maybe let's just introduce our so uh I run the Gana department now for over a year I think and um yeah that's all sort of visualizations data sources uh and I also work with Carl and Matt um Carl do you want to introduce yourself sure my name is Carl Bist uh I'm one of the first employees at graphon labs and one of the first contributors to graphon myself H I was working next to torl when he created graphon 10 years ago so I've been in this land or this this project for quite some time now um nine years still exciting still gets me going still excited to where we can go in the future still exciting to see people learn from their systems by looking at different observability signals um still super EXC abouts Matt how about you yeah hi Carl thanks Carl um yeah so I'm Matt ryer um I I've been at gra Labs now three and a half years I think and I came in starting doing the irm incident with the on call thing so the whole irm story and then also a AIML um and looking at places where that can help but more recently I've been focused on the new explore apps which are these sort of higher level pointand click experiences on top of the databases and we can talk more about them too um so yeah also thrilled to be here I'm excited for the reboot of the call campfire that's good cool um there's also two other gra people here right so maybe we introduce maybe you can introduce yourselves too right uh Ronald because I've seen you on the invite you part of the which group I I am part of the developer advocacy team so um yeah I've been at graphon labs for about five and a half years so not nearly as long as Carl uh but uh yeah I was on the go to market team so I was a solution engineer for a long time and have moved over to the pure open source side to do developer advocacy help people get started with grafana help people get engaged and uh yeah my team also works on grafana grafana we've got another team that works on some of the database tools so I'm excited to be here and and looking forward to this kicking back up that's great uh we also have Christina um you were gracious enough to join uh what are you working with uh I'm on I'm a senior engineer on the data Vis team so I like to hang out in the community slack and answer data Vis questions and uh just wanted to be a part of this for that that's awesome yeah I yeah I definitely appreciate uh Engineers answering Community questions I think that's always good um we also have uh mik sorry I'm just introducing everyone now that I'm seeing um we've also met uh I think a few times because you've been essentially like a big part of the community and just building I think a million plugins uh maybe you give a little intro to yourself yeah hello everyone my name is Mikel vov I'm a gra Champion one of the first one and yes we are building a lot of different plugins and now we call it business suit because we all combine them together and rebranded and we are working on something which called business intelligence which is something new and exciting we'll introduce soon that is cool uh how did you find out about uh this community call because yeah it hasn't happened in a while from David oh from David Allen okay yeah yeah so yeah yeah so he runs uh gaana community and the Champions program yeah and so it's I it's also announced in the public slack so we have a also public slack Channel called gra campfire uh yeah where you can hang out and also ask questions um during the call and after the call Sweet so yeah we also wanted to call this like a campfire because I think it just has a lot of Big T Big 10 Vibes campsite Vibes um have you ever been to a campsite Matt um I did go once but that was just a mistake I went into the wrong field I've got a little heater on here just for The Vibes it's electric heater unfortunately yeah next time maybe I will start a little fire that could be fun yeah that could be fun yeah oh you muted Ronald yeah double muted I was saying everybody needs a little fake fireplace or something behind them right yeah yeah that's true yeah we we also want this to be a little bit different to the Big 10 podcast I feel like uh that podcast is has more finish and uh they're going a bit more for sort of Timeless themes and um uh and a bit parts of it also a bit more around the product and so I think we're trying to keep this a bit more open sourcy and Engineering focused um but Matt you've been you've been part of that too right yeah I'm a regular on that podcast and it's kind of phenomenal honestly like um just digging deep on particular issues getting various people involved um some of the guests that we get because we're just very open with guests so we get some kind of amazing people and you just learn so much from it as well as get to just sort of hang out which is nice um yeah so I recommend the podcast it's it's available from wherever you get your podcasts as they say yeah that's pretty good um sweet so uh I was I was trying to figure out a bit what could we do as the first episode right of the the first version of the revamp and I think like two years have gone by I think it's just a long time so I thought we just look a bit at what happened um so so I I certainly um yeah had a had a chunk of my own growth here taken over the Gana Department I was just looking at numbers uh two years ago I think we were at 70ish people uh when the last call happened and now we're at 130 which is which is a bit crazy so just the gaana department alone and um yeah also Matt like you joined you came over from the incident team yeah but just I just count as one yeah you just yeah you're just one of those yeah and uh yeah but Carl you you've been you've been here for a while what have you been working on oh wow good question um I think it was about a year ago or something like that that I stopped working as much in our Cloud environment so so before that I I was um take lead for the host of grafana team which is the team that operates grafana in our cloud environment um now I work with multiple teams or or on special missions how to say so to say h but but that was my mission back then and I did that for three four years or something like that um that was also when we come to the conclusion that the way we operate Gana in our Cloud environment is is not good enough anymore so when we created our manag graan offering maybe seven years ago that was when kimet this was new and the idea of just deploying one pod per customer felt quite attractive to us because we didn't have to put a lot of effort into the grao project we could just say create a new one it's an API call and kuet St for us and open source team could just keep shipping open source features without dealing with Cloud problems uh as the service grew and grew and grow we got better at that but at a certain point we just decided now it's time for M tendency and we need a different way of operating graan and that is the big project we're doing right now and we have that further down the list that graan platform and I think that's that's an interesting topic because when you go from 70 to 130 people like working in the same code base is painful and and that's one of the things we want to achieve with that project make it smaller pieces so they can work in isolation that was a little bit of everything um I feel yeah that's a good am yeah that is a good amount yeah so we yeah you and I are working also very closely together um I feel like we spent probably a good year also getting um I guess like doing a bit of a shift towards devops right where um a lot of the G department is sort of have been the original graphanes almost right and they've been I guess like joined a company that built essentially like a little app that you can download and that was open source right and now we're operating a good part of it and so we also had to yeah just learn how to operate things and so we ran yeah a good amount of um sort of operational excellence meetings and and uh um I think we've gone yeah we've gotten we've gotten quite far I think and have a good uh yeah good set of internal dashboards which I think could be a good future topic like how we how we run grafana itself oh yeah that's a big project internally right now as well how to improve that so that's that's going to be interesting to talk about yeah we I was at a goer con conference in Berlin I think it was or maybe Athens um one of those places and uh non London isn't isn't Berlin like the Athens of the east or the other way around or something yeah yeah Berlin's like the Athens of Germany um I'm from the Athens of the UK London but this this was in a the Athens of Greece Athens they call it uh I think and we talked about devops particularly like yeah the point of like you build it you run it what does that mean and what does that get you and the the big reaction was that it was a big surprise uh that most people still had separate kind of operations uh Team different people and and there a lot of coordination needed and things and I was kind of explaining how it went down at grafana labs and yeah people were like very excited in fact the joke was can we come and work at graphon Labs that became like the running joke of the conference because of that so yeah I do think that is a topic that is worth talking about why devops what what why is it important that you run it and you're responsible for decisions you're making at the developer time and yeah caring about that whole flow and I think yeah I just I just realized and also like in all that transition of the engineering team I feel like I read a good amount of just devops literature and it it always starts with this sort of division between developers and operations people I don't think I've ever met a single operations person like in my life like I don't what what are they what's uh biger old Banks and things yeah say again Ronald uh I've definitely met some they tend to be in the like the big old organizations like think of the the big banks that have been around for hundred years they they definitely have this like strong culture of Divisions between teams and yeah it's often kind of like pulling teeth to get them to to push those things together even if the individual teams like the developers and The Operators are both like yeah we want to do this it's going to be better and more efficient breaking down those structures is often tough I think it's it's harder to to rebuild the structural um you know the the actual team structure than it is to do the engineering a lot of times yeah the reason you've not met many Ops people is because they're fighting fires all the time David they're busy and genuinely like I think I think their job is harder I think the idea that obviously as a developer I love the idea I can just throw it over and someone else has to worry about it I do that is very appealing um but I've been burned enough times or you literally like decisions you take you really got to consider like this has got to run and yeah I'm the one that's going to be making sure this runs I'm going to be a bit more careful here than I might be otherwise or make other decisions you know so yeah it is a really is really interesting how you see that behavior change when when it's it's Blended but I was surprised too at this conference I mean I'm from kind of startups mainly where you you you don't even have a department you can't have enough people for a department um or if you do you're doing it just to get the letterhead title for the email um so I was surprised too but the every and they did work at a lot of big companies but the majority of them at this conference in the Athens of Greece was um yeah that that's sounds like some dream to have Dev and Ops in one role but that is what devops is isn't it yeah that's what we've been told yes yeah that's what I was told too yeah but I mean uh Carl you you worked at the Swedish PayPal right did you yeah we we had an operations teams but they they were more um a platform team which you would call them today helping helping the developer teams to perform their work or finding toolings and um yeah I mean they did some classic hops work like provision VMS with certain version numbers and patching that and so on like in the background but but the main responsibility or main push or work for the company was was helping the pl the developers be faster be more resilient the developers Were Always On Call like and that's the that's the best way of increasing quality give the page to developers and it just gets better so I never worked with a strict Ops Department it's always been um platform or enablers but just be clear that company you worked at not called the Swedish PayPal is it but if not I it's such a good idea to just do that just be like yeah wa this is the Swedish PayPal it was for eBay before they split eBay and PayPal but I worked for like the the local site so it wasn't ebay.com but it was eBay company ah yeah yeah no it's uh I I I do think think that also over the last couple years we definitely focused also to build grafana itself for the dev Ops crowd right because we want to also just focus on S to like that sort of scratches our own itge but I do Wonder uh because there's still a lot of operations people around must be I mean as you said M they're fight and fires I I guess it's it's my hope that uh we'll we'll reach some of them here at some point when they join in the future episode uh because we do also want to as part of this and hopefully we'll find out more when this sort of gets continued month over month uh yeah if we're still building the right things right and so if Gana is still suitable for just Ops people alone yeah I I love talking to Ops minded people it tends to be the people who really cares about products uh in Productions and and customers I find that in many cases where you have the classic Ops and Dev split developers tend to care less about their customers and Ops tend to care more because when when things operates as expected they have a good week H when developers don't see that problem in those kind of companies so I love working with opmed people that that's for sure and I say minded because like it's always like you can be in the same team do different kind of works pushing together but but there's a certain mindset to doing operational work doing quality work doing s work and all that kind of stuff that's a little bit different compared to just writing really good code in following certain design pattern and so on which would be like only Dev minded yeah that's a nice Point like even if you even if your organization has separate Ops and Dev things it is still good to have a a good mind for yeah what how is this going to run where in the real world what can go wrong with it like yeah things can go wrong so what can go wrong how can we mitigate that or defend against it maybe or maybe we're okay with the risk yeah but often if if you just think in this sort of siloed way and you throw it over the wall um I do think you I've seen it before I've done it myself where you make decisions and then in the reality of running it you think it's actually was a bad bad idea to do it like this I have to go and rewrite it but in startups it's very common to sort of you have to do a bit of everything you know obviously in bigger rugs it's different but I do think it's harder to just do purely Ops role and other people are building the thing I think those people are kind of great honestly because I think that's really hard devops is easier having having it developers you build it you run it is easier and that's why we do it too I think from other side there is also customer success people who wants to prevent this kind of fires and we this is where my background background actually is so and this is how we started to use grafana actually to prevent this kind of fire so we know about the problem even before it reach devops people they have to fix it so creating all kind of graphs right proactively monitor something which can happen and then you you just tell it to developer people Ops people and they fix it before it's actually happen and affect customers this what I like about grafana you can use it AC the whole organization from Del for delivery standpoint from operations customer success and uh different business cases as well yeah Mel do you do are you do you like write code and do operation stuff uh I have a team now who is I'm mostly doing reviewing a lot right now I review so many things but the team I have director of engineering as well on the company and we hireing as well because number of plugins increasing I less and less write it but yes we do write a lot of code I review it we submit pluggins every week something the team for graph team to review yeah but we also operate our own servers our own development environment and U uh the environment for the custo we're helping deploying environment for the customers and one of the topic actually which not mention a lot of me a lot of times that I mean for the cloud you expect that customers runs one in graphon instance where you have everything in the cloud but uh in many organizations they run multiple graphon instances like 50 of them hundreds of them for each C for every use for every customers for organizations to have this data separation and this is something it's not I mean there are all kind of tools right to to help you with that graan is a code uh Helm charts but there is I think there is not enough and this is actually comes to this topic how you actually operate and deploy it with multiple graphon instances and it's not not cover it enough and especially when you run in High Vol ability all Lo and there is a learning curve actually how you run it as a high viability and actually have distributed load as well because grafana can do distributed load alerts not that much and yeah this is why you have different bottleneck and this is why you need operations and Dev people to learn like to see when you increase your number of aler how you can prevent service degradation and I think you you you work with all this issues in the cloud and this is why I would love to learn more about your experience what Carl mentioned how what is the multi- tendency where you going because there is a concept of organization in grafana which I think it was the deprecated for a long long time but it's still there because people use it but I mean I gu and because of this bottlenecks and the alert mechanism I think it have to be something else so I would love to learn more about multi tenacy so yeah organizations in gra that that's a fun topic um we we've been wanting to cut that forever because it's um it causes security problems at a like even even Pace uh the implementation of organizations is not secure enough for us to use it in our Cloud environment um it was something that happened really early in grana's history and then we kind of didn't give it enough attention so we're not using it internally we know some customers are using it um and we are going to replace it eventually um how multi tendency is going to play out commercially versus open source I I I don't have an answer to that yet I don't think we have a public answer to that yet I I wouldn't assume that multi teny goes into open sources because that is more for for the people who want to operate grafana as a service which is more commercial than open source that depends on where you lie on that scale or like what how you're using grafana um as for how to operate many instances we have a lot of tooling that is bespoke to us and we do not really want to share them because um like open source we are strong Believers in open source of course uh uh but but open sourcing also takes time and efforts and and reduce your ability to change things uh the pace you want to go at sometimes so by open sourcing all of those custom operators it put slow us down and and make our Cloud investment slow down and we don't want to do that also we want the freedom to just replace them very quickly whenever is time um so that's a little bit of a story for our Cloud environment scale uh if if if I were to operate 50 instances on Prem I would probably go with hel charts or something like that like some kind of configuration layer on top of Helm charts to make it easy to create new instances and manage them the same way but right but I mean it's a one one question how to start the mon operate start stop operation part and other part is uh the tokens right how you do the token service accounts Dashboard management because I mean when you run different QA environments station environments production environments and then you have to replicate and move it around with dashboards have the whole life cycle that's a totally different challenges and there is no tools for that nope this this is this is all in the working so so if we think about grafana projects uh maturity we we we are investing heavily in what we call the gra platform and maybe we can talk about that a little bit and and and that is our backend architecture of the future uh and where we have more consistency and make it make things easier to automate so we are very inspired by the katus API server in this project so instead of trying to reinvent everything ourself we are going to use the the patterns established by the API server API patterns or authentication patterns and everything so pretty much everything that you can automate with ketes is going to be able to automate with grafana and people manage to automate a lot of things for kulat right um but we're getting there we're getting in there um yeah I saw the repository I thought there are a lot of things in grafana um organization happening there are all kind of Innovations it's really hard to track them and they're not I mean they're published from in blogs from time to time but you have to actually go to organization like see oh graan is working on that piece on that stuff but yeah it will be nice to have more visibility in that as well yeah we're we're definitely uh so you mentioned alerting Also earlier right and I feel like that's also one of those features that has undergone kind of like multiple iterations and I think we also had a sort of probably one year of just headache around like how alerting was used uh with different engines running in the background and uh that's definitely a good topic for like a whole episode essentially where're we're going to try and get uh someone from the alerting team in yeah to really explain what they have been working on where does this all going um because we do want to ultimately deliver a good experience for both like on Prem but also how to run this um cost effective and and at scale for US yeah yeah we can schedule it actually I I would be really interested in joining this one because we spend a lot of time with alerting and in the current state I mean every time it became better and better but still there are a lot of pain how you configure it how you create new alerts how you always provision and test it and especially the way how you move it from environment to environment because nobody wants to run create alert on production environments when you have SMS notifications to the customer right you test it somewhere then you have to replicate it and that that can be improved many other things yeah no I think yeah uh yeah there's a whole sort of as code and kind of um like driving grafana instances sort of externally uh initiative uh going and um we really hope to have something also by next graphicon to talk a bit more publicly about this uh which is happening in yeah like six months in May yeah so yeah not many months left to get that done um sweet so um I was also curious because I think very early on today we chatted a bit about like in the last two years um is there anything that's sort of stuck out for you as a feature like maybe Las gicon um or the one before um that you thought was exciting and could also be a full sort of topic for an upcoming episode um anything for you Carl I it took us some time to get there maybe too long but that's a conversation and and that is nested folder so we launched no folders in grafana 4 or something and then we took us six versions to to launch nested folders and you know saying that we support folder structures but only one level that's that's that's a little bit weird uh like there's a good reason for it um but I I'm really happy that we have n folders now so people can create better structures for their dashboards instead of having you you know everything in Ro um because that's just messy yeah also I wanted oh sorry David go no go ahead go ahead R I just wanted to say a big thanks for that one because I like I said I've been here for over five years literally my second week on the job I was talking to an IT executive at a big Bank in New York and the first thing out of his mouth when he heard that I worked at graan Labs was why don't you have nested folders and I I met with that guy every few months for years and literally he asked me that every single time so like getting to tell him that they were there was one of the highlights of my life yeah yeah so um I'm always curious when people ask that question like how how many levels do you need because this can go really deep really quickly and then depending on how it's imp mented this can be like really yeah really gnarly um do people just want teams essentially and then the next level down is the sort of within team organization or do you do you do they want more do you do you have a good s Ronald Oh I thought you were asking Carl uh yeah definitely teams like the big request was like for this Bank in particular as an example they they didn't you know they have literally thousands of dashboards they they weren't able to divide them up kind of logically you can argue that's too many dashboards and I've had that argument with people but you you can't always change their minds um yeah so what they really wanted to be able to do was have like regions and then teams and then inside the teams a set of dashboards so like two or three levels is probably enough for I like go out on a limb and say 95% of the use cases I've ever heard of um probably 100% but if I forget something I don't I I want to head so I protect myself like people I've never heard anybody be like yeah I want something 100 folders deep like nobody wants to Nest that deep I think if we had 10 people would probably in 10 levels people would probably never even hit that limit yeah I mean 10's already a lot yeah trying yeah I think two or three is is honestly what what people really want like I want to be able to say team like my team and then like Dev and prod and then 10 dashboards inside of each one makes it e super easy to navigate yeah I feel like there's a sort of maturity sort of curve where in the beginning you might try to get by with just sort of tags or kind of like the dashboard label mechanism but then people start duplicating dashboards and like not updating the tags and then you just find stuff that you shouldn't find and then uh and then you just get to this sort of more disciplined way where you have someone go in and sort of start having a proper directory of things right yeah then you you go one level deeper and and teach them to use Library panels but that feels like the the last step on everybody's Journey yeah that's a I mean that's one of the recent features right like do have you seen any uptake there I yeah everybody I've ever shown that feature to like their eyes bug out of their head like everybody wants to have this ability to uh um create the golden view of something and then not have people screw it up later like that that is one of the biggest complaints I've ever heard in talking to and I've talked to a bunch of organizations using grafana it's it's not a complaint about grafana it's more a complaint that hey my teams all go off and they build their own dashboards that are all slightly different from one another and they can't agree on what the truth is and so being able to say yeah you can build this library and literally just have people inherit p and you make a change they get to pick that up like people love that I I think we could do a better job of I don't know if if it's discoverability or surfacing that or maybe giving some mechanism to enforce it like I I don't know how you would enforce that kind of thing but it'd be great to be able to say like you know clippy pops up from the bottom and says hey it looks like you're trying to build a latency dashboard you should use the stuff that already exists instead of rolling your own but uh yeah people love it everybody I've ever shown it to is is excited about it I like I like clippy yeah I think we have probably every hackathon there's a clippy submission that does that does one or one or the other aspect of grafana tries to help you out with something um but uh the one that you mentioned we haven't had yet I think that would be a good next one yeah all right that'll be my hackathon project do you participate Ronald I never had have I I have so like I said before I was on the sales side previously and um you know the good news bad news is I was literally on sales calls all day every day just didn't have the the time or bandwidth to do that so like it's good for the company from a sales perspective but I always looked at the people doing the hackathons and uh had a little little twinge of envy that I didn't get to be involved so uh my new role I feel like it's a lot more up my alley I can make an excuse that that's part of my day job Ronald I thought you did your book in the hackathon I thought your first release was you just did it in that week oh yeah I knocked it out in two weeks yeah no that was that was a lot of nights and weekends everybody says writing a book is hard so I was like yeah so still be a lot of work and and it it was like 10x more work than I thought it would be yeah it's good though I recommend it app recommend it yeah but but honestly uh because there there is no restriction right like go to Market people can participate in hackathons I I also think you'd be sort of primed to actually give a lot of sort of testimonial requirements where that are just from the field um I've I've watched a ton of uh hackathon submissions and I feel like the ones that also have this kind of uh direct user feedback or testimonials I feel like they they usually get quite far also in the sort of um sort of finals yeah I think they're trying to like encourage that somehow a little bit more I'm not sure if that's going to be true yeah I don't know how how they're going to do that but I I know that's up for conversation because we we we do know th those hon tend to be a little bit better yeah but you so you were you were a judge this time right yeah is there is there any sort of new requirements or anything that's we um we red we simplify the scoring a little bit but otherwise I think it's the same as last time we have two categories this time we have the normal category everything goes and then we have an AI category where you can um have a hackathon around some kind of AI capability into one of our products or anything I guess uh and we score them independently so you can win prices in both categories so that the second category is probably going to change uh every hackaton uh and General one is always going to stay and we can we'll see what what other categories that might be yeah I think we I think we tried really hard to resist any category right for like a long time because as soon as you mention one you already shaping a bit sort of the creativity it's actually I think it was only a handful who submitted into the AI one or a slml most most people went into normal one a year ago people people would probably do the other way around uh because AI was more hyped I think people are um not as e to do that today yeah yeah our our hackathon project has AI in it but it's not an AI thing but we just use it to give you a little extra and I I quite like that application of AI honestly I mean I year ago everyone tried to do something with text to to like use elements if that was Cor dashboard titles descriptions if you had an excuse to create a piece of text then then you would use AI for it yeah David or Carl do you think it's worth just mentioning what the hackathon is for uh folks that aren't part of Graal apps yeah I mean we have hackaton weeks three times a year and during these weeks n one company it tends to be mostly Engineers but anyone at the company can sign up uh as a team or as Sol if they want to and uh they spend a week doing their hackaton project and then they record a video uh submit that and then judges will look at those and score them uh so we get a list of I think it's 15 um in total that then will be part of the second round of judging and will it go down to three and during the last all hand or during the monthly all hands the whole company will vote for a winner between those three submissions so it's it's a very very big thing acun lamps and we like it a lot we we yeah Matt ryer was actually a part of the hackaton video that we played at graic on during the keynote because like hackaton Acron LS has a lot of good ideas we explore a lot of good ideas that and many of them turn into real features in our products and also the platform team that we have internally they do a lot of hackaton and they turn into internal toolings a lot of them turn into great internal toolings they should get more credit for those because they they're very helpful things like when you you do a internal PR for infrastructure changes you'll get a comment about the cost changes after that PR and and a lot of other Co things yeah no yeah there's definitely a good chunk of sort of under appreciated work from the platform teams but uh Christina was on the call has also participated at least once uh because we also ship one of your features do you want to talk about it uh the command pallet yeah yeah I mean honestly to I can't take credit for that because I wasn't part of the hackathon team for it but when I first got hired Acana they were they kind of gave me the hackathon repository and they're like go nuts can you make this for real and so I got to be the first person to kind of take a look at the hackathon project and translate it into something and since then it switch teams and I think it's grown to Way Beyond like the hackathon or even what I did so um but yeah that was a like the command pallet changed how a lot of people use grafana in their workflow and uh it was really uh it was really great to be a step in that uh from the hackathon to like what you have now yeah yeah for for a while this was like everyone I talked to I I told about the command pallet because it's um like for me this became kind of the way to navigate for a while but um I felt like then there was this period where we just put too many things in the command pet because it's like sort of became a victim of its own success uh but now I think there's even a whole like research project around um how could this all be sort of combined with search uh itself right because um because I think uh there was a time when I looked at grafana a bit as vs code right and vs code for a long time had the separation between commands and searching for files for example right or like searching for things and always thought I was quite good but um I can also see if it's structured well enough right that you can kind of combine the two uh and so I'm trusting the ux team right now to come up with a good recommendation there on how to and how to change this up yeah but I love that though that a an idea from the hackathon got put together usually like there's no rules you can just literally hack it together if you want to to tell the story and get it get it across um and then and then that then makes it I love those when those features make it into the product um and you know it's like there's something else about what the impact it has on the organization because this is like saying you you have like lunch complete creative freedom to tackle something that you're interested in or that's been bothering you maybe or just something you've seen sometimes it's in a completely different part of the company and it's like you know things are going a certain way and there's may be a different way to look at it um and yeah and then I think it levels up everything because then when it's non- hackathon you're still in that mode you're still like ah I'm still a person here that gets to have ideas and gets ideas make them happen you know get them into the product and have an impact and I think I think that's what attracts so so many great Engineers to Graff Labs honestly and why they stay at refal Labs I think a big part of it is that and the hackathons and that kind of spirit that culture it's the best place I've ever worked oh that's nice no offense to all the other places I've worked I realize it's just um a troll again on my CV really there but but yeah I mean go down the list on LinkedIn yeah just yeah just go down the list and pH them all up um so uh Matt um the last two years anything that stuck out for you but like besides Deo apps because I feel like they're sort of a thing for him on now on yeah that is well that was going to be my answer though so you can you can talk about that if you want well it's just uh this this only because like this kind of came the explore logs was the example that came out of a hackathon project um and yeah the idea being so you know you've got these phenomenally powerful databases and you can use the query languages to query things in and do all sorts of amazing complicated things and I think anyone that's Ops heavy it really it makes sense to learn those languages learn those tools so you can get the most out of it if you're doing it every day that totally makes sense there's a lot of people where um they don't maybe maybe they touch it once a week or or they have a few queries and they just edit them you know but they they're not really going to invest in learning um all the all the kind of Rich feature set so the explor apps try to essentially like proactively make all those queries for you and just give you the visualizations and give you the results and usually it's volumes in a histogram so you can see spikes you can see Peaks and troughs and things um just in the data and that turns out to be very powerful for a lot of user cases um one of my favorites is a Dos one uh dkit um had uh a Dos attack and was able to use explore logs to not only notice it was a Dos attack because obviously big spike in in the logs that were being written but able to drill in and find the thing that was unique about all those requests so that they could then go and write a rule to block that traffic so that was a a nice example where you not D didn't even look at the logs it was just the metrics that came out which Loki is very good at doing produced the metrics to show you uh insights from those logs and was able to just sort of take action on it um so I like the fact that explore apps opens opens up all this capability to more people you don't have to invest and go and learn the advanced things you can save that for when you really need it you can just go and start exploring data and uh everyone can yeah I spent so much time learning Lo though yeah it's going to waste now some people don't want to do it for that reason some people are like no I don't want to explore up I know and honestly there's nothing wrong with that they can do more powerful things and classic Explorer of course is Big Tent so you if you if you're working with lots of different data sources um then you would still need all those skills this is these apps are built on top of our databases so yeah if you choose graffan tech you get all this extra stuff for free um but yeah there are people that that really want more Pro Tools from it a lot of the early feature requests the Explorer apps get are coming from a pro perspective and it's hard for us we this is a careful balance we have to strike of how much do we enable because of course we want Pros to be able to do this stuff without over complicating the tool and making it uh just difficult or just another Pro Tool you know so I want to give you some credit for the incident app as well because the way that was built internally I think that was kind of um it was a nice thing to follow along so we have a lot of incidents internally right and and whenever you call an incident three years or four years ago that thought that was painful because you had to do a lot of things manually and and every week there was just like a minor tweak of things you didn't have to do like it became a button and then it created SL everything around it it created slack it it started automating things and every week there was some small improvements to instance that you kind of got curious to figure out while you were also dealing with incidents um because we we use incidents a lot we we rather call incidents early and and then call it off and say there was nothing instead of waiting too long and don't foring that was that was um interesting internally yeah I love the incident featuring I I really appreciate that you know it was um the in having that big internal audience using it just having basically a really friendly customer um was was just invaluable and yeah the questions the immediate feedback we would get um and you know everyone's kind of excited to help and then when when ideas came in that then made it into the app and got actioned it's like that was just a very nice feeling and and lots of people across the company and customers us have contributed to the product in that way and that's also why I love um not just open source but these kind of community uh efforts as well so we can have more of that um yeah you just can't beat it building for real people solving their real problem and you soon know if you're if you're not doing that it's very clear you know so it's great uh it's kind of yeah great to get that feedback nice and early and it o meant we could because we dog food did it internally um a lot by the way a lot of people don't like the term dog food some people say drinking your own champagne it's quite nice we're not a fancy as that as is just sparkling dog food um but the uh it was kind of broken in the beginning the app um in in some ways it was you know there were things that would just not work in it um and so having a friendly audience where we could just still give them things that weren't fully baked yet um is was was also very very helpful nice I was I was just browsing a bit uh to see what else came out like a grafana 10 n because it's been such a long time uh I I think the the um the canvas panel definitely needs a shout out because it's one of those kind of like uh slow burning things that never really got big prioritized but uh the sort of the datais team just keep sort of improving and improving it and so now it's it's sort of ready to uh to yeah essentially draw anything and you can attach Dynamic data to it right and so they made some cool demos around like a wind farm or you could do your own like data center right and like each little box could have an updating either sort of like a color or like an actual number right and you can just go crazy and illustrate essentially and um that started with a hackathon project too and uh and then just over the years now just I think got really to a really good point um have you have you seen any of this in the wild Ronald I I haven't seen anybody using it in like in corporate settings I've I I think it's kind of as you say it's the the Polish It's The End state that people go go to I don't think anybody kind of starts there and and frankly what I was doing was seeing people at the beginning of their Journey for the most part uh I've definitely seen folks using it more on the community side I I even use it myself I I tried to draw a picture of my house so that I could put like you know when I've got door sensors I've got temperature sensors and it became very quickly apparent to me that I'm not an artist but um but I could still get the data onto the panel so I've definitely seen a lot of folks do that if I look at the you know the ution engineering uh organization inside of grafana labs see a ton of people building cool visualizations with it and and like you know um goal oriented like this is where you could get to in the instate that they're showing to a lot of customers so I think people are probably using it I just don't get to see but you know because that that tends to be the later on things there it's so easy to set up you know a time series panel or a table panel that I think people start there yeah you could take a photo of your house Ronald what's that you could have a photo of your house there I I actually thought about that I started to go down that path and decided that um it would actually take me longer to get the the good pictures than it would have just draw I ended up drawing boxes inside the the canvas panel it's very easy to make rectangles are you using AI assisted when you're coding no I I didn't with this I I wonder I don't know is there uh something that can I I can just describe R my house or give it a a couple of pictures and it can make a picture for me yeah almost certainly yeah [Music] that I have something to thought about the canvas panel I mean I love it I use it a lot for different customers for the big machinery especially when you have a lot of moving Parts you got a lot of metrics from a sensors for IT project it's it's very it's great uh I have a lot of uh different questions about canvas panel where on how you Channel and we created one of the videos how we created a pizzeria observability when we actually have a pizza ow as a special component in the canvas panel and there was a really low old request feature request to add our own something like a plugin for this custom elements like you have a drones you have a wind farms and we create our own class for for pizza ow right so it's something we got a lot of questions in the last two years how actually people do that because now you have to code it then you have to build your own grafana Docker container right and run it I mean it will be not easier if we can actually have a special type of the plugin like a panel uh which uh to add the canvas elements Advanced elements I think that's a great topic idea too so we can for hackathon uh well for hackathon but also for uh a future episode here of a community call um because we can get uh the team essentially in that build it right and then learn a bit on also what they're uh what they're currently working on and um and also like the more we hear the use cases right the more we can sort of figure out what to focus on um yeah not as Brillion so yeah we're almost almost at time uh I'm curious Mel um as as a sort of champion representative do you have any any sort of questions for us any other sort of topic ideas that we should be covering in the future I mean there are other topics we already discussed right the canvas panel alerting I would love to learn more about it um there are so many things I mean every every in the previous Community calls there was every week weekly there was different team it was monthly right it was different teams and one of the community call I remember was with um Ryan McKinley team mhm it was one of my favorite one from Community C it was one of the latest one and I mean I got so many information there when I just started it was really a world World opening for me so it's something I'm I'm I hope it's going this community calls will be the same impactful for the community yeah oh yeah I mean we can definitely get Ryan in here he's also yeah he's moved closer to our time zones now here makes it easier yeah so having different people different people from different teams talking what they working on and I'm excited for new graphon I will be there going to be Seattle it will be easier to get there yeah absolutely yeah so we finally settled on a date right uh May 6 till May 8th uh 2025 um it's also a bit of an internal deadline for us to uh to finalize some features that we want to showcase there um and yeah I guess it's uh it's also North America time right like last time was Amsterdam um yeah which was a really cool location um and then Seattle I think is going to be going to be great too do you know what kind of features come in in graphon 12 so uh so the biggest thing that we're working on that we all sort of aligned around is um sort of the the management of grafana instances when it comes to dashboards and like the whole is codee story and how to have uh yeah like a much better handling around this um and so um essentially supporting gitops a lot better and hopefully also getting to a point where um you can also have this kind of better promotion from one instance to the next right like staging to prod uh um and yeah but we have to figure out how far we how far we we get essentially because uh we're also changing the architecture because like why why keep it simple when you can also like have it difficult um but it's uh yeah we're uh we're making good progress there and we have a good a good set of people on it and we um yeah formed a little tiger team around this and they're making good progress is it going to be some kind of preview or you just announced iton so uh um I I think we're going to release sort of bit by bit right because uh the way Ganon also the way we want to set this up is uh if it's a one-year event um we we can use this as a sort of like look back also this is what we worked on over the year because we're also a SAS company right so we are releasing feature of the feature already continuously to cloud and then every week and month month when the uh when the on Prem releases are being formed the community can use this already right so there's this sort of trickle of features already coming out and uh and Gana content is really becomes the once a year event where you look back seeing everything that was shipped to the community um and also then hearing from the engineers themselves right like how how the feature was develop where it's going um yeah that's the plan okay I me because the reason why I'm asking it's something we are working on as well internally at wof flops we have our dashboard management idea we are working on so I just want to be aligned and maybe uh see what you come up with and maybe we can share experience what we we want to do with it or how we we see it happening but I'm excited to see what you will get same uh talking about this a constant updates in grafana Cloud it's actually really hard for plug-in Developers yes you always do something and sometimes when you use Advanced features it's always something unexpected happens especially with the graphon framework this is why we constantly Daily building all our development plugins on the main bran yeah that's yeah that's a good topic for another episode right like plugins uh our rolling release channels and how that all works together sweet all right uh um I think that's all we have time for today then uh then thanks for everyone coming to the first grafana campfire and then I'll see you all hopefully next month cool thank you guys should I put the fire out David I think good yeah I think that's good C campsite etiquette yeah I'll see you next time see you everyone see y e
