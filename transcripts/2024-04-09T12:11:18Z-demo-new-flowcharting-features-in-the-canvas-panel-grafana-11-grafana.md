Transcript: Hi there. I'm Drew Slobodnjak
from the DataViz Squad at Grafana. Today I'm excited to announce an update
to Canvas that includes some much requested flow charting features. You
can now customize your connectors. Select a connector, drag midpoint controls as desired
- with horizontal and vertical snapping. Make a section
straight again to remove a point. Open the editor to change the
line style, arrow direction, and corner radius. You can also add a corner
radius to most elements. Rotation was also added.
Select an element. Drag the rotation control
above it until you are happy. We've also added popular flow
charting elements for you to try out, and we look forward to your feedback.
Thanks from the DataViz Squad at Grafana.
