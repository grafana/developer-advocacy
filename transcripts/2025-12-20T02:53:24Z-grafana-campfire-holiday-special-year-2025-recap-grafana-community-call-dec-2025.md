# Grafana Campfire Community Call - Holiday Special Transcript

**Oh yeah, we are live.** Hello everyone. Welcome to this very amazing episode of the Grafana Campfire Community Call, which is the holiday special season. 

Today, we are not going to talk about something new, but rather about things we have already seen this year. Sorry, why is my audio echoing? 

**Oh, I don't know. I don't hear the echo.** 

Well, we decided today to have a kind of "Christmas Carol" theme here. We will be visited by three ghosts: the ghost of Christmas past, where we will look at what has happened in Grafana this year that we are excited about; the ghost of Christmas present, which will discuss what’s happening right now; and of course, the ghost of Christmas future. By the end of it, Carl, you can be Scrooge, and by the end, you’ve got to be nice.

**Okay. So, what does it mean? I have no clue about this story, to be honest.** 

He’s going to be nice to people at the end.

**Well, in the beginning, you're not very nice.**

**Okay.**

**Oh, I don't think so. Khal is always nice. He’s hosted a couple of times as well.** 

We can leave that, but yeah, that's in real life. He’s nice, but in this, he has to be bad at the beginning; otherwise, there's no change or story of redemption at the end.

**What’s Scrooge’s motivation in the beginning?** 

He just wants money.

**Yeah. Okay.** 

He won’t give Bob Cratchit any coal for the fire.

**Oh yeah. He doesn’t help the charity people when they come around. He just says “Bah, humbug” to them, which is rude.**

That's rude.

**People did use coal in their houses in London a long time ago.**

Yeah, until recently. 

**And also, your coal is what you get for being naughty; you get coal in your stocking instead of something good, like a PS5.**

Yeah, it’s sturdy.

**Okay, so...** 

I want to know: what was the thing that happened in Grafana, ghost of Christmas past, that was so exciting this year?

**So, you want me to start?** 

Why not?

**Okay. Please.** 

If I’m going to start by being grumpy, I would say that it took us 10 years to mess around with dashboard JSON to finally create a schema. This is kind of bad, really unprofessional. About a year ago, we started creating a schema for dashboard JSON, and we're about to launch it. This is massive! The amount of integrations and automation we can do now with dashboard JSON is going to be phenomenal. We’re soon about to hit version two as well, which means everything going forward will be possible to migrate back and forth. There are so many good things about the schema for JSON. Initially, it was fine, right? When we started off Grafana, we just got things out there. We didn’t even have a back end; there was just a front end at that time. Creating a schema would have slowed us down. 

But we should probably have done this four or five years ago. But here we are, and now it's a big deal. Those are typically the things that get me excited these days: the platform things that enable other things to be built on top of Grafana. 

**Yeah. And people do, don't they? There’s like a whole ecosystem of stuff that gets built.** 

The community finds very weird ways of using Grafana—exciting and awesome. Making that easier makes me happy.

**More graphs.** 

Yeah, you love graphs.

**I think that’s it for me. Do you want to go next, Matt?**

Yeah, I think the drill-down apps this year developed a lot.

**It's crazy fast anyway.** 

We did GA for all of them at the last Grafanicon. That was a big one, so maybe that counts.

**Yeah, it counts for the argument. Let’s say it counts.** 

Yeah, I love it because for me, it's all about getting value from the telemetry. How do we make that available to more people? Drill-down apps were a massive step in that direction, I think, because you suddenly don’t have to write the queries; the app just writes it for you now. 

It was a bit of a “Bah, humbug” for the Loki team and for the Mimir teams and stuff because the UIs suddenly started to hammer the databases in interesting new ways, but the database teams rolled with it. They did work to make it much faster, and they also stopped complaining as much, which is fine.

**And then you unleash the assistant on them.** 

Yeah, so then we have the assistant investigations, which swarm over the telemetry, running lots of agents concurrently. They're getting a bit spammy as well, but I tell you, we’re big fans of our databases. We use them a lot.

**I think something fancy with the drill-down apps was that our databases finally get a UI to some extent. Before, they were just backends, and you kind of had the Grafana explorer being the only UI, but these are a more catered experience to our databases. That makes it easier to demonstrate their value.** 

Yeah, and the design team, the engineers, and all the product people involved really think about what you’re trying to do and the problems you’re trying to solve. You get a sort of opinionated experience as well. 

If you're new to Grafana and you don’t really know what you should be looking for, having this data presented to you in an opinionated way with a UI that you can use to drill into it is a great step forward. The teams did such a fantastic job. I know the drill-down apps are very popular. 

**I don’t know if we talk about the numbers, but I was very impressed by them when I heard them.** 

Yeah, I think—

**Oh, sorry.** 

David?

**Yeah, I’ve been thinking a bit about what was really good. Because a lot is what others don’t see, right? We had a huge department sort of work done around changing the internal architecture. That needed tons of people working together to make it easier to run Grafana for ourselves while keeping up with scale and new users joining all the time. Seeing this come together and finally hitting a stride was amazing. But that’s nothing if we do this job well; then others won’t see anything, right? That’s the annoying part. But one of the outcomes was a clearer schema architecture that Carl talked about and version APIs that feed into the Git story. Now you can have dashboards maintained sort of in your Git repository. I thought that was really cool. We announced this at Grafanicon, and we’ve been wanting to work on this for years. We had internal hackathons to present ideas around this, and now this already works on-prem. We’re currently working to make this work on the cloud as well. That’s really been my highlight—to see this come together.**

**Yeah. All of the as-code stuff is very exciting, especially because with Cursor and other AI-assisted IDEs interacting with code, that suddenly becomes very valuable. If you can have your infra stuff and your observability stuff all in GitHub.** 

Yeah, and even asking it, “What am I missing? What should I be monitoring that I’m not? What’s best practice for this?” You can do a lot of discovery like that. Of course, the Grafana assistant is built for things like that. You can use the MCP server, and there’s actually a Cursor integration as well, which we’re going to be adding more of. You can even do tasks like that, really up-leveling things and learning discovery. If you have a new code base or if you're migrating, these AIs being able to interact with code like that is very powerful.

**Yeah, absolutely. We also did a bit of a department-wide directive to think about tweaking the UI a bit more to make it slightly more usable. First, you should think, "Is the underlying representation good for it to work as code?" That’s becoming more important, even for the assistant to work with this or represent it in Terraform. Some of our biggest customers rely on us for vital infrastructure now, right? They need to be able to maintain this properly, so that's becoming increasingly important.** 

**Yeah. So, of course, because it’s Git, you’ve got pull requests and stuff. You have all the tools we use for reviewing and collaboration. So, those processes really help, don’t they?** 

**How about you, Matt? How did you curate your best of the past?** 

Well, the first thing I did was ask Chat GPT to summarize all the stuff because there’s no way to keep track of it all. In our company Slack, there’s just loads of innovation happening and loads of new things. I don’t know how anyone keeps track of it all. But Chat GPT did quite a good job for me and just said, “Drill-down apps.” I was like, “Yeah, I worked on that, so I’ll choose that.” I still selected from it, but it did the work for me. I think that’s how you should use AI: to level yourself up.

**Any highlights?** 

Well, drill-down apps are a big one for me. I think the Grafana assistant, we’ve talked about it as well. I’ll probably talk about it a bit more because there’s a lot coming in the future, which is very exciting.

**Saving that for the future, I guess.** 

Yeah. I can also share some light. For me, I think like all of you, I wanted to talk about features as well. While we are releasing a lot of new features, one thing I see a lot of improvement in is our documentation. Our documentation this year has improved a good part, thanks to the Dev Advocacy team and the big tent OSS team. If you now check our plugins, data sources, and plugins documentation, it’s much better. 

Another aspect I really love in terms of features is the combination of drill-down and MCP server. With the help of drill-down, it’s simplified for new users; you have all the data, but with the MCP integration, you can get that data in a more contextual way. Then there’s the Grafana assistant if you want to get more detailed reports generated for your environment. So, that’s pretty much the main highlight for me.

**Yeah, I think the drill-down apps also, because the assistant knows how to build the URLs for deep links, as you drill down, it just updates the URL and applies different filters. That's really what's happening as you select different views. We taught the assistant about how to build those URLs, and that’s why it can jump you right into the view you need to look at, which is great for finding logs and metrics that matter to your particular context.** 

**Yeah, again, good work.** 

And also, for me as a user, I mean logs and metrics are traditional because in your application, you will always find these two things. But then comes part of the traces, and traces are tricky. They are important, but it is very hard to write a trace. With this drill-down, tracing actually got super simplified; you don’t need to memorize all those traces or worry about syntax. It gives you the basic idea of the water flow model of traces and spans. That’s a big win for me.

**Yeah, I think the same goes for profiles as well. Metrics and logs are things people have more experience with, but profiles are extremely powerful when you need to get into what's going on and optimize things. We work with Brian Borum; he's a big name in the Go community and very into optimizing. He calls himself the debugger of last resort. He needs to get right in there with the details. He knows how to work with profiles, but if you don’t, the drill-down apps and profiles are very nice. There’s also the flame graph explainer, which uses LLMs to summarize the data for you in natural language and lets you ask questions about it. That’s extremely powerful because flame graphs are great visualizations, but to actually understand what they mean and where the problems lie, having that context is invaluable.**

**So, it sounds like Brian has a service then, I’m guessing?** 

I don’t think Brian’s a fan of AI, but that’s probably because it’s not as good as him yet. But it’s as good as lots of us already, so that’s why we’re using it. I think a lot of experienced people will give it a high-level prompt and find it doesn’t do a good enough job. They could have done a much better job themselves. But the point is you’re prompting it, and you’re deciding its behavior. You provide more context. I find I’m still doing the engineering; I’m just not writing the code.

**Did you give it context that you’re a Met Ryer and to code like that?** 

You can say that, yeah, because it’s trained on the internet. One reason we think it’s so good in the context of Grafana Labs observability is that so much of our stuff is open source. The community has created content out there: all the dashboards and everything that these LLMs have seen in their training gives it this superpower. 

I talk a lot about code format in Go in particular, so I do sometimes say, “In this particular style,” or something like that. It’s weird, but it works.

**Did you know about the Grafana cloud knowledge graph?** 

**Yes.** 

Tell me more.

**It’s good.** 

Yeah, it understands not just individual telemetry but the topology of the system automatically. It gives you this knowledge graph, which you can then use to enhance things like RCA tasks and root cause analysis. I thought that was fantastic, and it’s helped the assistant be so much smarter when the cloud knowledge graph is enabled.

**This is going to be about the assistant if I don’t shut up. So maybe someone else wants to talk about it, and I’ll save it for the ghost of Christmas future.** 

**Have you ever seen a ghost?** 

Seen a real ghost? Oh, thank God. Not really. But maybe in my dreams, yes, many times.

**Dreams about ghosts, Carl?** 

No, no, no. I do not believe in ghosts. 

**But I do believe in ghosts. I think there is some energy, something.** 

But you’ve not seen it yet.

**Thank God, no. Or should I? Should we see?** 

No, I don’t think I’ve ever dreamed about a ghost; I think it was always people.

**Yeah, exactly. People are scarier in my opinion because they can be real.** 

This sounds like a Swedish crime novel.

**Yeah, I read that.**

Alright, what about things going on right now? What are we most excited about right now? Do you want to talk about that, David? 

**The Christmas... Is that the ghost of Christmas, right? What?** 

Yeah, ghost of Christmas present.

**Present. Present. Yeah.** 

So, in the film, read it.

**I was going to say, in the film, what does the present person bring? Does he have some attitude?** 

I think he just starts off really massive and says, “Come and know me better, man.” I don’t know what that means. 

**He’s massive; he can’t fit in the room.** 

And then he’s like, “Oh no, I’ve got the wrong aspect ratio setting on something.” Presses a button, and anyway, he goes to normal size. I think he’s all about generosity and the now, all that stuff.

**So, appropriate that you go first, David.** 

Yeah. My beard kind of blends into my jumper.

**Oh, I thought you had grown your beard out.** 

Yeah, I have. 

**What am I most excited about?** 

We recently had a hackathon, and usually I’m judging those, but I skipped and tried to do some coding with Cursor and all that stuff. I was amazed. I think that’s something I’m really excited about—how even as a manager who hasn’t used Grafana for years, it is now possible to contribute. 

That probably makes some people scared because then it’s like… But it’s also exciting to see how the barrier to contributing PRs is sort of lowered again. I feel like it was harder in recent years to contribute because the codebase ballooned massively. We’re shipping so many features that there are just multiple code paths and feature flags. Working through that with AI tooling was also not trivial, but it made it possible for me to get a feature going in a couple of days.

**What did you build? You want to say?** 

I created a little performance tracker for dashboards. When you run queries or like on your dashboards, it’ll show you little performance metrics, similar to gaming UIs where you see frames per second. It shows you how much time it took to render, how much time was spent querying the data source, and how much time was spent in transformations. 

Sometimes we have people come to us and say, “Oh, Grafana is so slow,” but it’s quite easy to tell that it’s your other data source causing the delay. I think that also makes it easy for you to performance tune your dashboard. You can see, for example, “All of these queries here are taking more than a minute—maybe I should have a recording rule or something like this.” 

I think I still need to add this to the documentation, but Cursor did a great job writing a bunch of docs. I’m a bit scared because I think what I just described is about 700 lines of code, which is a lot. In my old days, I would have done this in hopefully half the lines, but it’s getting a good amount of coverage with tests as well. I’m quite happy. It found a bunch of things around making it safer with RxJS, which is a library I hadn’t played with before. Working through some issues with Cursor together made this all quite accessible for a manager like myself.

**I’d love to see that feature. I also wanted that. If you give a format, I might be able to pull out the backend latencies for queries, database queries, and so on. That seems interesting.** 

Yeah, that’s such a cool idea. But this is what AI does; it unlocks a lot of this stuff. 

**With rules, you can set up rules in the project that apply sometimes or always. There are different ways to do this with the agents file or Claude. That’s a Claude MD file; there are a few others. That’s a great way to tell it nuances and particular things about a codebase so it just knows more things when you ask it for stuff. I find even just discovery—just asking a question of how this is implemented—can be great. I use Cursor, which has an amazing code index that maintains a vector search, so you can search semantically without getting the language exactly right.** 

**How much?** 

Oh, go ahead, go ahead. 

**I was just going to say we force our internal revenue team and everyone to use Grafana to render and look into the data. We’re going to have a talk at Grafanicon in April about how we use Grafana at Grafana for BI purposes. There are definitely changes and improvements in that area.** 

Yeah, there was some good progress already. In the beginning, they were furious, but now we’ve built some panel-to-panel filtering and better ad hoc filters. Now it actually works for them, and they’re no longer furious.

**I think that’s a real thing: fury-driven development. I genuinely think like release early products that are useful but not everything, and then people will tell you what else they need. That’s a great way to drive the roadmap. You’re really solving real problems.** 

**I mean, we do keep saying like dogfooding is one of our core values, even if the dog food needs a lot of improvement in the beginning.** 

Yeah, but we’re getting there, so a lot of people are happier. Some people prefer drinking your own champagne as a phrase, but I don’t know. 

**What’s more difficult to make, champagne or dog food?** 

I don’t know about the process for either. 

**I wish I did.** 

It can only be called champagne if it’s from a very specific region in France. I don’t think that’s the same for dog food.

**Otherwise, it’s just sparkling dog food.** 

I think you can make dog food anywhere. In the EU, it has to be human edible in order to be sold, so you can eat it.

**I didn’t know that.** 

We’re in Britain, right? So anything goes.

**Yeah, you can eat it anyway.** 

I think, speaking a little bit about Grafana, I’ll just share my screen so the audience can know. 

Grafana is coming next year in 2026 in Barcelona around the month of April. We would love for all participants to apply to our CFP. The CFP is open, and you can just click on this link to become a speaker. Fill out this form, select the topic of your choice. You can do a 10-minute lightning talk or a 25-minute main talk. Submit something cool you’re doing for your daily Grafana use case or maybe a lab project that’s fun and interesting. 

We would love any of those things as well. I’m also helping some speakers; we have a team on our Grafana community Slack. You can join the Grafana community Slack to get ideas, tips, suggestions, and feedback. So do that. You have time now; it’s the holiday season. If you’re getting bored and thinking, “Where should I go next year to speak?” then Grafanicon is the right place to do that.

**Amazing!** 

We just added a new session type called the Science Fair. If you have a cool way of using Grafana to track cars, tennis balls, or if you built your own golf simulator, you can use Grafana to track that. There’s a session category where you can apply to demo at Grafanicon. We want to showcase a lot of these weird and wonderful use cases of Grafana—not just for talking but also for showing. Last year, our CTO Tom had one of his car tunnels at the conference where you could see the aerodynamics of the car.

There are many fun ideas for how to show Grafan action. 

**And don’t feel like what you have to say isn’t interesting. A lot of people I talk to make that mistake, and I dig in, and it turns out they’ve solved something that’s either very different or something that everyone needs to solve. There’s a big chunk of people that haven’t figured it out yet, so it’s worth applying. I know the team does a great job selecting talks as well. The program you get on the day is fantastic. It’s one of my favorite conferences.** 

**Yeah, for me as well. I was there last year and had a great time meeting not only Grafanistas but also some amazing people from the community who I only knew from chat or GitHub. It’s a fun place, and a lot of exciting things happen. Plus, I also want to highlight the golden growth awards. We have this category as well, which means if you have a dashboard that you feel is really useful and has all the right values, you can apply to this category. We will have a selection of the top picks from the dashboard category, and if you’re lucky, you can win this award. Last year, we had two winners because I think we have two categories, right?**

**I forgot the names, but I remember we have two categories. Does anyone know?** 

I know a Chat GPT that might!

**I just don’t type fast enough. But yeah, that is fun. They win them for the best personal dashboard and professional dashboard.** 

**Not why I thought originally professional dashboard and unprofessional dashboard. That’s different. We don’t have a category for that yet.** 

**I would actually like that category. I have a lot of unprofessional dashboards that are still used professionally, so that could fit.** 

Let’s do it!

**Yeah. But it is a fun conference.** 

**Do we have anything else we want to discuss or just say something?** 

Hold on. I think Matt hasn’t talked about his future.

**I mean, he sort of has throughout this call.** 

The assistant is my main focus. I don’t know if this is announced or not, but maybe we’ll leak something: we are going to make the assistant available in Grafana open source. It will still be running in the cloud; it’s still a cloud feature, but it will be available everywhere. 

Particularly, if you’re new to Grafana and need to learn new concepts or if you’re coming from different observability platforms or creating your own hobby projects like part of the Science Fair talks, having the assistant there to help you is just so useful. The LLM has good instincts for Grafana because of all the open-source stuff. 

You think about having your telemetry data, and then it’s queries to access that, and the LLMs can generate those queries through natural language. They can also follow up on things they see. So, as they allow them to investigate things, we’ve added tools for dashboarding. You can ask it to create a dashboard that shows the top five most important things for monitoring CFKA, and you get a sensible default because it knows what you should care about when it comes to CFKA. 

Of course, it doesn’t get everything perfect, so you can keep chatting with it and iterate with it, but you still stay in control. I think we’ve seen, you know, it’s been very helpful. We’re thrilled with how many people have told us that it’s helped them do their jobs more quickly, as well as new people using it that could only really use dashboards before. 

Everyone can look at dashboards; it makes sense. But beyond that, they weren’t going to edit queries. They weren’t writing and running their own queries to look at the data slightly differently. But now they can ask those questions, and the LLM will generate the queries for you and render them. 

Next year is going to be very different for observability when it comes to interacting with it, accessing it, and automating things that are otherwise total. The idea is it frees you up so you have more time to think about what’s next, and that’s where I feel we’re starting to see the advantage. So, yeah, I’m excited about that.

**I think this is definitely big news because I already got asked in some community forums by users if the Grafana assistant can also be available in the open-source part, but now you announced it as a leak.** 

**Yeah, it’s a leak announcement.** 

Sure! 

**Yeah, cool.** 

I just use it to search. Whenever I’m looking for a dashboard, I noticed I was just using it today. If the normal dashboard search comes back empty, you now have a button to just click, and it makes the assistant go. That’s pretty cool!

**Yeah, you’re going to see more of that. We’re not crowbarring it in, and we’re also quite late to the game here because we didn’t want to ship AI for the sake of it. We really waited until there was something special. I think having that high standard is important because there’s so much AI slop and hype that I can see why people are just like, “Okay, you just figure it out and let me know when something works.” That’s what we’re saying: this is actually useful AI. That’s our motto.** 

But it is good!

**When was the last time you used a real crowbar?** 

A real crowbar? I don’t think I’ve ever used one.

**Me neither, actually.** 

Monkey Island, maybe? I played that back in the day.

**Do you have a crowbar? Does anyone have a crowbar?** 

I think I might have one. 

**Yeah? Have you used it then?** 

Yeah, I have.

**Yeah. You use it to get nails out, you know.** 

The other side of a hammer does that, I suppose, doesn’t it?

**Yeah. You know, sometimes you need a bigger hammer.** 

A tradesman came to our flat and said, “Sorry, my hammer’s in the car. Can I borrow yours?” I said, “Sure.” He said, “I’ve never seen a hammer in such good condition.” 

**Like, even when they’re brand new from the shop, they’re not looked after this well. I just never used it. Not very handy around the house.** 

But it is always good to keep at least one. You never know!

**Yeah.** 

Also, you don’t need to use it.

**True. You can just keep it and look at it on the shelf. It looks nice. You look handy. It makes you look more butch, which I need.** 

Yeah, just a hammer on the shelf. “What’s that? Just my hammer.” 

**Yeah, I’ll do that! But you never know. You’re right. You never know when you’re going to need it. It has been...** 

Although, be careful on Christmas Eve because remember if Santa comes down the chimney, leave the hammer on the mantlepiece. It’s just Santa.

**Yeah. Or I can replace the hammer with a different hammer, like a Thor hammer. That’s my hammer. You know it has magical powers as well.** 

**That’s that!** 

If I had a Thor hammer, I’d totally have that on the wall.

**Yeah, for sure!** 

For that, we have to make some calls or maybe pitch Grafana in a way like, “Yes, get my hammer!” 

**Get my hammer. Fetch the hammer.** 

No matter how much we try to get hammers to take off as a thing, I don’t think we’re doing it. I just think that the hammer nails him.

**So, Carl, in Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol, he’s visited by three ghosts who scare him. They show him how he wasn’t very nice. He lost a love in the past; they take him back and remind him of that. It’s Christmas past. Christmas present is about generosity and shows times when he hasn’t been generous and the impact of that. Bob Cratchit’s Tiny Tim isn’t doing great; I’ll tell you that. In Christmas future, death takes him and points at his grave. He sees that no one comes to his funeral or, if they do, they just come to try and steal the coins from his eyes. It’s a tragic demise for old Scrooge. When he wakes up, it’s Christmas morning. He’s not sure if it’s a dream or not. But I don’t believe in ghosts. Those spirits scared him. Then he was a changed man. He took a big turkey and said, “Hey boy, get me that turkey!” Take it to Tiny Tim’s house. I don’t know where he lives. Even at that time, the population was massive. But in the book, it’s like, “Yeah, sure.” They go around, and everything's good. He was redeemed. So, Carl, you’ve been grumpy. You’re forced to finance people to use your tech that isn’t good enough. You’re talking about forcing all the schemer on everyone; they don’t get a choice about whether it’s a bull or a string. You just have to insist. So that’s your evil. Are you redeemed? Is there something you’re now changed? Do you have to now be changed for this to work?** 

Oh, tricky question. Do I feel redeemed? Am I redeemed? 

**Yeah.** 

I think we want to focus more on making it easier to build on top of Grafana. I think that’s my answer. 

**Yeah. That’s the equivalent of helping Tiny Tim with his medical bills and paying Bob Cratchit’s mortgage. Helping people do that. So, there we go. It’s a happy ending. God bless us, everyone!** 

**Yeah. So, I think we had a really great episode also today. Thank you, everyone. I again want to thank the whole Grafana community. I personally want to thank these three individuals here because we really had a great year in 2025, and 2026 will be even better and more exciting. You know, at Grafana, we’re always creating, making something new, improving something, and making it for the community. Enjoy your holidays. Be safe. Drink and eat a lot. Enjoy the time with your friends and family. We will see you next year. Till then, take care! Bye-bye!** 

**Happy holidays, everyone!** 

**Happy holidays!**

## Raw YouTube Transcript

Oh yeah, we are live. Hello everyone. Welcome to this very amazing episode of Grafana Campfire Community Call which is the holiday special season. Today we going to talk about or today we not going to talk about something new but something what we are already have seen or you have seen. Sorry, why my audio echoing? >> Oh, I don't know. I don't hear the echo. Yeah. Well, we decided today we were going to do a go a kind of Christmas carol, Dickens Christmas Carol uh theme here. So, we're going to look we're going to have be visited by three ghosts. We're going to be visited by the ghost of Christmas past where we look at what's happened in Grafana this year that we're excited about. We're going to look at the ghost of Christmas present, what's happening right now, and what's imminent, and then of course the ghost of Christmas future. Um, and then by the end of it, Carl, you can be Scrooge, and by the end of it, you've got to be nice. >> Okay. So, so what what does it mean? Like, yeah, I I I have no clue about this story to be honest. >> He's going to be nice to people at the end. >> Well, in the beginning, you're not very nice. >> Okay. >> Yeah. >> Oh, I don't think so. Khal is always being nice and he he he always I think um being I think two times the host also in emergency cases as well. So >> we can we can leave but yeah >> that's in real life he's nice but in this he's got to be bad at the beginning otherwise there's no change and there's no [laughter] story in redemption at the end. Yeah. >> What's what's Scroo's motivation in the beginning? He just wants >> he's just all about money. >> Yeah. Okay. >> Yeah. He won't give Bob Cratchet any coal for the fire. >> Um. >> Oh yeah. >> Yeah. He doesn't he doesn't help the charity people when they come around. Just says Bar Humble to them, which is I think rude. >> That's rude. >> So people be grumpy. >> People did use coal in your houses in London long time ago. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. until right to [laughter] >> and also your coal is what you get like that coal is what naughty children get for Christmas you get in your stocking instead of like something good like a PS5 you get a piece of coal which is not as good >> yeah it's sturdy >> sturdy yeah okay so >> yeah I was that say I want to know like what was the thing that happened in graphana ghost of Christmas past the thing that happened that was so exciting this year. >> So, you want me to start? >> Why not? >> Okay. Okay. >> Please. >> Um, so if I'm going to start by being grumpy, I would I would say that it's took us 10 years to mess around with dashboard JSON to finally create a schema. And this this is kind of bad, like really really unprofessional. And about a year ago, we started creating a schema for dashboard JSON. We're about to launch it, right? And this is this is massive actually. The amount of integrations and automated automation we can do now with dashboard JSON is it's going to be phenomenal and and we're soon about to hit version two as well which means like going forward everything is going to be possible to migrate back and forward and there's so many good things about the schema for dash.json JSON and like initially it's fine right like when we started off Grafana it was just get things out there uh we didn't even have a back end there was just like a front end at that time creating a schema would have slowed us down but >> we should probably have done this four years ago five years ago but here we are and now it's a big thing so it those are typically the things that get me excited these days like the platform things that enables other things to be built on top of kana Um, yeah. Yeah. >> And people do, don't they? There's like a whole ecosystem of stuff that gets built and things. >> The the community finds very weird ways of using graphana. Weird and exciting and awesome. Um, so so making that easier is makes me happy. >> More graphs. >> Yeah, you love graphs. >> I Yeah, I think that's it for me. Do you want to go next, Matt? Yeah, I think uh was the drill down apps this year. I think they developed a lot. >> It's crazy fast anyway. >> We did GA all of them at last Grafanicon. That was a big one. So maybe that counts. >> Yeah, it counts for for the for the argument. Like let's say it counts. Yeah, Dr. I think I love it because for me it's all about like getting value from the telemetry and how do you do that? like how do we make that available to more and more people drill down apps were a massive step in that direction I think because you suddenly don't have to write the queries the the app just writes it for you now it was a bit of a bar humbug for the Loki team and for Mamir teams and stuff because the UIs suddenly start to dodo the databases and they were like really hammering them in in interesting new ways but the the database teams like just rolled with it they uh you know did work to actually I don't even know what they did but I know that what they did made it much faster and they also stopped complaining as much which is fine. So >> I mean and then you and then you unleash the assistant on them. So >> yeah so then the assistant and we have the assistant investigations which is the thing that swarms um swarms over the telemetry. have lots of agents running concurrently and yeah they are also like get yeah they're getting a bit spammy as well but I tell you yeah it's yeah we're really big fans of our databases we we use them a lot >> I think something fancy with the drill downs app was also that our databases finally gets a UI to some extent like before there been just backends and you kind of have the graphon explorer being the only UI but these are more catered experience to our databases And that that makes it easier to demonstrate the value of them. I really like that part of it. >> Yeah. And the design team and the engineers and everyone all the product people involved like they really think about what what it is you're trying to do and the problems you're trying to solve. So you also get the sort of opinionated experience as well. So if you that's what I mean that's why I like it. If you're new to Grafana and you don't really know um what you even should be looking for, you know, having this uh the data presented to you in an opinionated way with a UI that you can use to then drill into it. Um yeah, that that's I think a great a great step forward and the teams did such a fantastic job. Um and I know that the drill down apps are very popular. I don't know if we talk about the numbers, but I was very impressed by their numbers when I heard them. Yeah, I think >> Oh, sorry, >> David. >> Yeah, I've been thinking a bit about like what was really good. Um the uh because a lot is what others don't see, right? So like we had a a huge department uh sort of work done around changing the internal architecture and that needed like tons of people working together um and to like make it easier to run graphana for ourselves also and like keeping up with scale and new users joining all the time and so that was like seeing this come together and now finally really hitting a stride like that I think that was that was quite amazing but that's nothing if we do this job well then others won't see anything right like that's that's usually the >> like that's the annoying part >> but also one of the things that came out of this was a uh sort of a more clear like the schema architecture that Carl also talked about and version APIs and that that sort of feeds into the gits story so that now you can really have dashboards maintained um um sort of in your git repository. I thought that was really cool and so we announced this at Kofanicon and also been wanting to work on this for for years. We had internal hackathons to present ideas around this and then so finally now this already works on prem and we're currently working to make this work on cloud as well. So I think that's that's really been my highlight to see this come together. Yeah, the all of the as code stuff I think is very exciting especially because now with uh cursor and other like claude code, claw desktop, other AI assisted ideides interacting with code like that suddenly is is is very valuable if you can if you can have your infra stuff and your observability stuff all in GitHub. Um yeah and I think like even asking it what am I missing? ask ask cursor like um yeah what am I missing from from that I should be monitoring that I'm not or what's best practice for this like you can do a lot of discovery like that of course the graphana assistant is built for things like that and you can use MCP server to and there's actually a cursor integration as well direct one um and we're going to be adding more of those so you can you can even do tasks like that with assistant of like really upleveling things and learning discovery so if you've yeah if you've got a new code base or if you're migrating or thing. Um I think the these AIs being able to interact with code like that is is very powerful. >> Yeah, absolutely. And it's um we also did a bit of a departmentwide directive to essentially like if you think you should be tweaking some of the UI a bit more to make it slightly more usable. First you should think like is the underlying representation good for it to be worked as with S code, right? Because that's for us just getting more and more important even that the assistant can work with this or that you can >> represent this sort of in Terraform or something because yeah like the the some of our biggest customers to them is vital infrastructure now right and so they need to be able to maintain this all properly and so that's becoming more and more important. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, of course, because it's Git, because it's GitHub and Git, you've got also like pull requests and stuff, you've got all the tools that we use for reviewing and all the collaboration like that you get. So, it's again, yeah, you're right for if you if you really have to be careful about what you do and at some point you do have to start being careful, unfortunately. Um, yeah, then you're right that those processes really help, don't they? >> How about you, Matt? Were you how how did you curate your best of the past? Um, well, the first thing I did was I did ask chat GPT to summarize all the stuff because there's no way to keep track of it all the time in a different bit of Slack of our company Slack. There's just loads of innovation happening and that loads of new things. Um, I don't know how we keep anyone keeps track of it all. Uh, but CHP did quite a good job for me and just said drill down apps and I was like, yeah, like I worked on that. So, choose that. So I still selected from it, but it did the work for me. And that's I think how you should use AI. Use AI to level yourself up. >> And any highlights? >> Well, drill down apps big one for me. Um I think like yeah, the Grafana assistant, we've talked about it as well. I'll probably talk about it a bit more because there there's a lot coming in the future, which is very kind of exciting about >> saving that for the future, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. I I can also share some light. So for me I think um uh like all of you actually shared the features which I also wanted to talk about but uh while we are re releasing a lot of new features. One thing which I see a lot of improvement is also in the documentation. uh our documentation this year has improved uh a good part also done on the document documentation improvement by the dev advocacy team and also by the big tent oss team as well. So um if you now check our like plugins data sources and plugins documentation it is much better. The other fact which I really also love uh in terms of features is the actually the combination of drill down and MCP server because with the help of drill down obviously it's more simplified like as a new user you have all the data but with the MCP integration you can get that data in a more contextual way um and yeah then there is graphana assistant if you want to get more uh detailed report generated for your environment So yeah, that's uh that's pretty much the main highlight for me. >> Yeah, I think that um the drill down apps also like because the assistant knows how to build uh build the URLs basically deep link because drill down apps as you drill down you just updates the URL and applies different filters. That's really what's happening as you go and selecting different views. So we taught the assistant about all the way to build all those URLs and it can that's why it can just jump you straight in not to the right app but right into the view that you need to look at something that you're talking about. So yeah that as a way of finding logs and finding metrics that matter like to your particular context the thing that you're focused on. >> Yeah again I think it's yeah good. It's good works. >> Yeah. and and and and and I also uh for me as a user I I mean logs and metrics that they are very traditional because uh in your application you will always found these two things but then come part of the traces and traces are tricky like they are important but it is very hard to write like a trace and uh with this drill down the tracing actually got super simplified you don't need to memorize all those trace what should be the uh the syntax and how it should work. It gives you on the fly and you can get at least the basic idea of this like waterflow model of traces of the spans. So, uh that's a very big win for me actually. Yeah, I think same for profiles as well because you're right metrics and logs people have more experience with profiles are extremely powerful when you really have to get into what's going on and if you're really trying to optimize things you know I we work with Brian Borum. He's a big name in the Go community. He's very into optimizing. He calls himself the debugger of last resort. Um, and so he's like he needs to get right in there with the details. And so he knows how to do all that with profiles. But if you don't, yeah, the drill down apps and profiles is very nice. There's also like the flame graph explainer which again uses LLMs to take the data and actually summarize it for you in natural language and let you ask questions about it. That's extremely powerful because because flame graphs I think once you learn how to use them like they're great and they're kind of nice and they're a good visualization but to actually understand what does this really mean where what is where is the problem still within that and then have >> so it's a bit it's a bit Brian has a service then I'm guessing like if you >> yeah I don't think Brian's a fan of AI um but that's because he it's probably not as good as him yet but it's as it's as good as lots of us already so that's why we're using it. Um, but I think yeah, it might might be a few more frontier models needed before we get to Brian's level of intelligence. Maybe it's that >> which is still very good, right? Like the fact that it start at his level doesn't mean it's not useful farther far away from it. If you get to get it at halfway there, then then that's very useful for a lot of people including me. >> Yeah. But but I think that is a thing like I think a lot of people that are really experienced they'll give it a high level prompt to say cursor or one of the IDEs that are LLM powered and and and it just doesn't do a good enough job on it. You know they're much they would have done a much better job themselves. Um but the point is you prompt it. It's you prompting it. You're deciding its behavior. Um and so you you if you provide more context like I find I'm still doing the engineering. I'm just not writing the code. But like I asked it to put a retry in uh for a network connection and it just put it in line and I was like maybe if if that was the only one I was doing in this project, maybe I would do that. But actually I want this as a class. I want to be able to reuse this. So let's pull it out. Um and I just explained how I wanted it to do it. And then they they then follow your bidding and do the heavy lifting for you. Um and then when you start >> did you give us >> did you give us context that you that you're a Met Ryer and please code like Met Ryer or >> genuinely you can say that yeah cuz the thing is obviously it's trained on like the internet. One of the reasons we think it's so good in the context of Grafana Labs observability is because so much of our stuff is open source. All the community have created all this content out there. all the dashboards and everything that that these LLMs have seen in their training gives it this sort of super superpower and I think um because I talk a lot about code format and stuff in Go in particular you can I do actually say that sometimes like in this particular style um or something like that yeah which is it's weird that is weird but it's weird that it works did you know about the the Graphana cloud knowledge graph the asserts knowledge graph that came Yeah. >> Yes. [laughter] >> Tell me more. >> It's good. >> It's good. >> Yeah. Yeah. So it kind of like understands it's not just dealing with individual telemetry but it understands the like topology of the system uh automatically and gives you this knowledge graph which you can then uh you know use to enhance things RCA tasks and things like this root cause analysis or contributing factors whatever. Um, it's just I thought that was also kind of fantastic and I think it's also helped the assistant be able to the assistant is so much smarter when when you have the cloud knowledge graph enabled. Um, it's one of the night, you know, the assistant will this is going to be about the assistant if I don't show up. Um, so maybe someone else wants to talk about it and I'll save it for ghost of Christmas future. >> Have you ever seen a ghost? >> Seen a real ghost? Oh, thank God. Not really. But maybe in my dreams, yes, many times. [laughter] >> Okay. Dreams about ghosts, car. >> No, no, no, not I I do not believe in ghosts. >> But I I do believe in ghosts. I think they they there is some some some energy, some something. >> But you've not seen it yet. >> Thank god. No. Or should I should we see? >> Yeah. I don't think I' I don't think I dreamed I've ever dreamed of a ghost or just I think it was always people. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah, people are more scary in my opinion because they can be real. [laughter] >> Like I know ghost is real. So like it doesn't scare me. >> This sounds like a sounds like a Swedish crime novel. [laughter] >> Yes, I read that. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. All right. >> So what about things going on right now? What are we most excited about right now? Do you want to talk about that, David? The Christmas is that the goes to Christmas, right? What what >> Yeah. Goes the Christmas present. >> Present. Present. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> So, in the film, read it. >> I was going to say in the film like what what what's the what what does the now person bring or the present person? >> Present. Yeah. >> Do they have some attitude? >> Uh I think he's just he starts off he's really massive and he says, "Come and know me better, man." And I don't know what that means. Like, well, come in and get to know me. Just say that. >> But he's massive. Like, he can't fit in the room. >> And then I mean, like, he's like, you know, and he's like, oh no, I've I've got the wrong aspect ratio setting on something. Presses a button. I don't know. And anyway, goes normal sized. I think he's all about like, yeah, the Christmas present, like all generosity, the now, all that stuff. >> So, yeah, he has got a big beard. So, it's appropriate that you go first, David. >> Yeah. Yeah. Cuz my my my beard kind of blends into my jumper. Yeah. >> Oh, I thought you had grown your beard out. >> Yeah. Yeah. Know that's just peppered. Um the what am I most excited? Well, I So, we recently had a hackathon and usually I'm sort of judging on those, but I uh I skipped and then uh tried to do some like coding with cursor and all that stuff and uh yeah, [snorts] like I was amazed. So I think that is that's really something I'm excited about how even as a manager who hasn't [laughter] graphana for years it is now possible to contribute which probably also makes some people scared because then then it's yeah um but I also for me it's exciting to see how the barrier to contribute PRs is sort of lowered again because I feel like it it was harder in the recent years to contribute because the code base just ballooned massively and we're shipping so many features that there's you just have multiple code paths feature flags and and even sort of working through that with in sort of in AI tooling was was also not trivial but it made it possible uh for me to get like a feature going in a couple of days. Um, I think it took a couple of days cuz I had to sort of um install yarn and all this, but but once that was going [laughter] >> couple of days >> I was off to I was >> I was I was off to the races. >> Yeah. No, we're we're we're investing a lot now in in uh making the developer experience better. Um, and I'm not sure the if the tilt setup is fully public now, but uh it's getting it's getting really good. >> Yeah. So, what did you build? You want to say >> I uh so something I've been always pitching in to sort of people who don't have hackathon ideas, but it turns out there's a lot of people with hackathon ideas. So, no one picked up my idea. Um so, it's it's a little uh performance tracker for dashboards. So, when you um when you run uh queries or like on your dashboards, it'll show you little performance metrics. So similar like in gaming UIs where you >> where you see like the frames per second and so and it shows this to you for um for like how much time it took to render, how much time was spent in querying the data source and then how much time was spent in transformations because that's another layer where some time can be spent because we cuz when cuz sometimes we have people come to us and say like oh graph is so slow but then there it's quite easy to tell no no it's your other data source there that that was kind of causing the delay. Um, and so, and I think that also makes it then really easy for you to go and um, really sort of performance tune your dashboard and you can see for example, oh, all of these queries here are taking more than a minute and maybe I should have a recording rule or something like this. [snorts] So, I think um, and that's maybe the part where I still need to add this to the documentation. But like cursor did a great job also to write a bunch of docs. Uh, in fact, I'm a bit scared cuz it's I think what I just described is I think 700 lines of code. Uh, which is it's a lot. So, in my in my old days, I probably would have done this in hopefully half the lines of code. But it but it's getting you a good amount of coverage of of tests as well. So, I'm I'm quite happy. And it found a bunch of things around uh making it safer with >> RxJS, [snorts] which is which is a library I just haven't played with uh before. and um just sort of working through some issues there with cursor together um like really made this all quite accessible um for a manager like myself. >> I'd love to see that feature. I also wanted that. Uh if if you give a format I I might be able to spill out the backend latencies for like queries, database queries and so on as well. That seems interesting. >> Yeah, that's such a cool idea. But I think this is what these this is what the AI does. it does unlock a lot of this stuff. Um, David, with rules, like you can set up rules in the project which are kind of either they apply sometimes or they always apply. Um, and there's different ways to do it with the agents file or claude. That's a claude MD file. There's a few others. >> Um, that's a kind of great way to tell it nuances and particular things about a codebase so that it just knows more things than when you ask it for stuff. But I do find even just discovery just asking a question of like how is this implemented and it'll go and search the codebase you know I use cursor that has an amazing code index that it that it maintains a vector search so it's semantic basically so you can you don't have to get the language exactly right you can just say you know this loader where the loader that spins the other way where's that one you say it like that and it will go and find it and tells you where it's used and yeah so I found the discovery use cases kind of great as I've I've also just posted my my PR here in the comments. So if anyone wants to >> It's public. >> Of course it's public. It's Grafana. So [laughter] you can you can have a look and and uh and and critique it here as like with the community. >> So it's pull request 114921. Actually that was a that was an access code I just got texted. That's a coincidence. It's [laughter] exactly the same code. It's a Christmas miracle. >> It is. It is a miracle. >> Speaking of Christmas present, uh can we talk about adaptive telemetry? Is that suitable for this call or is it cloud only? >> Can be. I mean, it's not Yeah, it's not fun community. Um Yeah. >> Yeah. But yeah, give it give it 30 seconds. >> Go on. >> Well, is it absolutely crazy? Uh we for some reason like we've decided we're going to look at all the stuff you're not using and then get rid of it and then you don't pay for it and we lose loads of money. Um, but that's in the spirit seriously like of Christmas present and generosity, you know, I think that's a that was a kind of nice move. Um, but why is it when the when adaptive telemetry costs the company millions of dollars, it's fine, but when I do it, I've got to have a meeting. [laughter] >> If you think about adaptive telemetry, >> yeah, >> we're not technically losing the money. We're just not getting as much as >> Yeah. getting the money. >> Oh, cool. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Is that how you sleep? >> We're helping. Yeah. Well, we're helping our customers save money, right? So, aligning their value with their value. >> That's it. Exactly. It's a feature that really helps cost management and stuff. Uh, so this is what I Exactly. I like that about Grafana Labs. But the thing is like when they have an incident, it's like, "Oh, no. Quick, we're making millions of dollars. Declare an incident. Wake people up. We're making loads more money because adaptive telemetry stopped working." It's the joke. But yeah, that's territory. I want to call that out as a sort of cool thing that the company does. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> So, we should fun the the Sorry, go ahead. Go. >> No, no, no. I'm >> Yeah, I was just going to say >> old fashioned polite off. >> We we should we should fund the MT more to declare more to have make it easier to declare more incidents. We need to go further than that because we did a demo of a someone was doing a demo of assistant um and they were like out a dinner or something and then the the that company had a big DOS attack or something some or some outage and they were demoing assistant and they just asked assistant in their stack what's going on and it just went and searched the temperature and found the signals and basically solved the problem. Uh and they were like okay yeah that's great. So, so I do think we should fund a new department which attacks customers when we're doing the demo >> so that we can get that experience every time cuz it sells itself. [laughter] >> It will be like a live selling. >> Yeah. Live selling or live experience of selling how how it works. >> Yeah. >> So you mean investing in Bitcoin and then losing the Bitcoin >> somewhere >> using the Bitcoin to fund the the DOS. Yeah. >> Yeah. Which which uh which spirit are you embodying here right now, Matt? That does this >> goodness present? It's the generosity one, isn't it? >> Okay. [laughter] >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, present as in all right now as well. It works because we're attacking do the DOS attack right now while they're doing the demo. So, I think it fits the theme. I think >> potentially. >> Yeah. It's going well. I think the the Dickens thing, even though Carl's never heard of it. Us heard of it. >> I I don't know. Like, we watch other things on Christmas here, I guess. Um, >> but it's like a It's like one of the classic books. It was a book originally. >> I mean, I I think I heard a name. I just don't know the story. I've probably seen it once. I've heard the name Scrooge, but I don't know what it what it kind of means or what it does. >> Have you not seen Scrooge McDuck from >> Yes. >> Yeah. There you go. >> Yes. Yeah, that's why he's so stingy with money. That's why he's called Scrooge. >> Yes. Now I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I I I was about to ask like a fun question here like because it's a Christmas theme anyway. So like what is your favorite Christmas movie which you like when you have like these holidays? What you always like to watch? Who wants to go first? >> That's a great question. Carl is do you even watch Christmas films at all? >> Oh yeah. I I I don't think I have one, but but the movie that I watch watch the most right now is probably Christmas Chronicles, which is one of those kids movies. The kids love it and it's it's a bearable to watch with the kids. So, that's the one I watch the most right now. >> Oh, nice. I don't think I've seen it. >> It's It's uh >> because he runs he runs a newspaper. Is it the Christmas Chronicle? And it's like we've got to get the final paper out on Christmas Eve. Is it that kind of thing? Uh, I actually don't know the story that well. Uh, don't I'm not sure I pay attention to it that much. >> Right. You're on your laptop while the kids are watching. >> Yeah, exactly. Can >> unfortunately embarrassingly enough. Yeah, [laughter] >> fair enough. >> I think I think I just have to wait for the kids to be old enough to watch Die Hard because then I think that'd be really cool Christmas. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Yeah. >> Yeah, >> that's good. I think there's a lot of people who argue that Die Hard is a Christmas movie saying like people should all accept it and I don't think anyone disagree with that take. It's just like the people arguing it's a Christmas movie and no opponent, >> right? >> Actually actually like like Die Hard is I think Die Hard four or five I forgot where the one is the is the uh which takes during the Christmas season and similarly uh one of the Rocky series is also during the Christmas season. So like these are the two movie which like are in the Christmas theme but maybe not qualify as a Christmas but people still like to watch it during during those seasons. So yeah it's it's like a small gray area like you want to watch some Christmas movie but then you're actually watching what you really like. [laughter] >> Yeah. An excuse. It's like an it's a it's an action film in a Christmas envelope. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I'll tell you another one that's like that is Gremlins and that is like a basically a horror film uh it turns out but I think I don't know if they made it for kids originally but it's way too scary for kids but it's set at Christmas time and there's this cute little gremlin called Gizmo and it's fine until you get him wet and then I won't spoil it but gets bad but that's technically must be a Christmas film. But I think my number one would have to be Home Alone. As as a kid, I loved the idea of setting all those traps for my dad. Swinging paint down, you know, nail on the step, tar on it, electric um the door handles. Electric >> electrocute every every door handle. Yeah. >> Yeah. [laughter] That kind of thing. >> Yeah. For me, >> go ahead. >> Sorry. No, no. I was saying like for me home alone one and two are the best and I also um uh like to watch uh there's one also like called problem child. It is very funny movie like I don't know if anyone have seen it like it's not a Christmas movie. >> Yeah. But it it has its own taste and it is very similar for kids like how how they can be uh fun and problematic but enjoyable as well. [laughter] >> Yeah. I think I saw that. I think I remember as a kid watching that. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> I might watch it again. >> Cool. >> It's time for The Ghost of Christmas Future. >> Yeah, let's do it. >> Visited by a third ghost. This one in a lot of the I think in the story and in a lot of the uh adaptations to film and Muppets, this one is like a death. Looks like death. It's got like a hood. has got a scythe sometimes. Um I think inside is just a skeleton. I don't know. Um so it's a bit grim that one because Scrooge doesn't have a good future, Carl. And this is where you're supposed to learn your lesson. But this in the analogy in this it's just what's what's the thing in the future that you're most excited about that we're going to do next year? The ghost of Christmas future. What do what do you reckon? For me, this this might not make a lot of people excited um but but I think it's going to be important for the graphana project and that is nailing our new arbback system so that we can set up permission uh in a good way for larger installations. So platform observability platform teams and platform teams can start gating the rollouts to enable like certain permission to certain teams and so on. and we have some capabilities there and we want to massively improve it um next year. And again, like this is probably not what gets a lot of people excited, but it's it's it's it's those things right now that that's makes me happy where Graphana is is not just like a playful toll, but but can be used in very large companies and with control from a centralized team. Um yeah. Yeah, that that that completely ticks it for me right now. Yeah. And it's they're hard. They're hard to do those pro those projects, you know. I think that's right. >> Yeah. Right. Go on. >> I mean, it's it's it's you you you need to have very strong opinions and you need to in like get a lot of teams at least at CRFunnel Labs where you have so many teams running very fast in certain different direction and they all need to align on like a permission model and that can't be a discussion. It has to be like this is how it's done and people are going to scream at you and say no we don't want to do it that way we want to do it this way and like no >> uh so I think that's going to be a lot of uh this conversations and decisions in the couple of in the next year and some frustration but at the end we're all going to be happy and we can all move faster and enable teams to operate graphana better. Yeah, good luck with that. That sounds like a big old big old challenge. >> Yeah, >> I I can go next. >> Oh, sorry. Keep doing that. >> Yeah. >> Um, so one thing which I am really looking forward for the next year is uh uh a project called Graphana Pathfinder. So it is already released recently but it's like a feature flag but uh it will really help um especially the new users for onboarding and creating like a like a tutorial experience within Graphana. So um uh already a lot of work is happening in the background and uh we actually um uh launched it at Opscon uh this year in London and it was pretty pretty big hit uh especially by the audience and uh because the challenge right now we we get is that yes we are releasing some amazing features but people need to like uh get onboarded quickly and with this pathfinder thing I think it becomes much more faster. So, uh that is something uh really cool. And um one other thing which is also happening behind the scenes is like we are continuously improving our data sources documentation. So not only we are just like not just updating but if improving how the users can connect uh successfully. So that is like seems small but it is a big big challenge as well. So because if you do not connect your source with graphana then you are stuck right and um uh and also we are creating these some learning journeys uh which is very interactive very fun and it gives you that uh that experience like hey I have my machine my own data how can I use xyz different kind of data sources to ship my metrics logs or traces to graphana. So uh uh that is that is something also very useful and uh I think next year it will become uh more bigger in terms like a knowledge library. Yeah. >> Yeah. That is very cool. I think like t taking on a guided tour of the of the tools and telemetry and things you need to know about and uh yeah because this because these the tools are so powerful and they're packed with advanced features that can sometimes be overwhelming. So just being able to be told like, yeah, these are the bits you need to care about first to get going. Yeah. And I think Pathfinder is a great way to kind of up level and get what get on board. So yeah, if you're new. >> Yeah. I mean I mean imagine using Pathfinder and Grafana uh assistance together like it's like a super combination of getting almost everything done uh for the user. So uh that is something will be really exciting. Yeah, I'm excited that there's a lot of um there's a lot of assistant investig assistant uh integrations throughout Graphana that are just fantastic and people add complete new features just by adding a button that has a particular prompt and attaches particular context and then the assistant kind of does the work but they're building they they kind of think of entirely new features that we haven't even thought about on the assistant team. Um, and so yeah, I think that that yeah, more of that I think is going to be exciting for those of that that choose to be AI assisted. >> Yeah, I think um any kind of documentation that's inside the product is usually quite beneficial, right? Once you have to leave to like get out and read up on some docs that it's always a problem. >> Yeah. I mean the the AI been visited by spirit. >> The AI I just I just got tea delivered. >> I [laughter] think I've seen a ghost that for the first time. >> I know. I know. That's crazy. Yeah, it's it's cuz I'm in England and I don't know. This is just >> Oh, mandatory tea. >> Yeah. Yeah, it's mandatory. >> You can't say no. Also, >> you I've given up that and now I'm tea total. >> That's just a friendly little Christmas joke. We have these things called crackers. Yeah, we have these things called crackers and on Christmas day we pull them and they snap open and inside there's usually a joke that's terrible that says like why did the penguin take a pickaxe to the party cuz he wanted to break the ice, right? It's a joke like that. I've just thought of that one actually. It's not bad. No, but they um the Yeah. So they're like deliberately bad jokes I think so that everybody's everybody's in on it and everyone sort of rolls their eyes. It's kind of tradition. Uh, so that was um Yeah, the tea turtle was one of those. >> Yeah. No, sounds sounds good. I'll I'll >> Yeah, let's write that one down. It's good. >> Yeah, it can do. >> I just remember it. If you >> wrap it in a cracker, >> it'll go well in in it'll go well. You don't have to put it in a cracker. Say it. >> If someone offers you tea and you don't want one, say, "No, sorry. I'm tea total." Especially in a German accent because they'll probably they'll probably just think that you think that's what that means. Yes, [laughter] I'm going to summon my German accent. Um, I'll try another thing what I'm excited about because we're we keep getting a lot of requests still like continuously for things that are no longer just around core observability. So, I guess like things that we refer to as observability adjacent. So, a lot of things around how to monitor your business also. And so for that we're trying to come up a bit with ways to integrate that into the core product, right? So bit of business intelligence. So I think we'll spend a good amount of time on that next year. So that's what I'm excited about. But um >> a lot of people use Graphana already for business intelligence of course, right? Anytime you're tracking costs or orders and things like this, it's kind of getting into that already. So it does feel like quite a natural fit that there might be specific things that you might need for whatever it is you're doing. I guess it's a lot of joins is it? I think that's >> Well, yeah. I mean, if you if you squint, right, you you have UI with channel panels and charts and whatnot and tables and you have data source connectors to uh sort of table based databases. So you could all put this together, right? But I think what's missing is the sort of like the analytics playground in between, right? To like get the get the data joined together and work with columns and so um yeah, so I think that's going to be an interesting area to look into. >> Yeah, definitely. >> How much? >> Oh, go go go ahead. I I I was just going to say that we force our internal like revenue team and and never everyone to use Grafana to to render the data and look into the data. Uh and we're going to have a talk at Grafana in April about that how we use Grafana at Grafana for BI purposes. So there's definitely changes and improvements in that area. Yeah. Yeah. There was there was some good progress already. Like in the beginning they were just furious. But now now we built some panelto panel filtering and >> and some better ad hoc filters and uh and and now it sort of actually works for them. Uh which is and then they're no longer furious. >> I think that's fury furydriven development is a very real thing. I genuinely think like release early products that are they you they do the thing but there's just it's not everything and then people will tell you what else they need and then that is a great way to to drive road map frankly you know you're sol you're really solving real problems in it >> I mean we do that >> yeah we do keep saying like like dog fooding is one of our sort of core values even if the dog food >> needs a lot of improvement [laughter] in the beginning >> yeah but we're we're we're getting there so they're they're a lot happier Some people prefer drinking your own champagne as a phrase. Um, but I don't know. >> Yeah. What's What's more difficult to make, champagne or dog food? >> Yeah. >> I don't know about the process about either. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I don't know enough of. I wish I did. >> I mean, it can only be called champagne if it's from a very specific region in France. I don't think that's the same for dog food. >> Otherwise, it's just sparkling dog food. No, >> I think you can make dog food anywhere. But I know that in the EU it has to be human edible in order to be sold. So you can eat it. >> I didn't know that. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. But we're I mean we're in Britain, right? So anything goes. >> Yeah. You can you can eat it anyway. >> Okay. Um yeah, I'm I think well we are speaking a little bit also on Grafana. So I will just share my screen so the audience can know. Um we the graphana is coming next year in 2026 in Barcelona around the month of April >> and yeah we will love all the participant to apply to our CFP. The CFP is open and uh what you can do is that just click on this link become a speaker and uh fill out this form. uh select the topic of your choice. You can do a 10-minute lightning talk or like a 25 minute of main talk. Uh submit something which you are doing very cool for your drif graphana daily use case or something maybe your lab project which is something uh fun and interesting. We will love any kind of those things as well. And uh I'm also helping some speakers uh we have a team uh on our graphana community slack. So you can join the Grafana community slack to get some more ideas, tips and uh suggestions uh feedback. So do that. Uh you have time now it's a holiday season. If you are getting bored and you're thinking like hm where should I go next year to speak then graphicon is the right place to do that. >> Yeah. >> Amazing. >> We we just added a new session type as well which is called science fair. So, if you have a cool way of like a a cool way where you use graphana to track uh I don't know like uh cars or um tennis balls or golf like if you do have your own golf simulator that you built with UI setup and you use Grafana to track that. There's a there's a session category where you can apply for demoing that at Grafana. We're going to have a lot of these weird and wonderful use cases of of Grafana uh that we want to show uh to people and not just like for talking but actually showing. So last year our CTO Tom had one of his car tunnels at the conference where like the you could see the aerodynamic um uh how do you say like uh smoke trans. So you can see the aerodynamic of the car. Uh so yeah, there there's a lot of these fun fun places or fun ideas for how to show graffon action. >> Yeah. And don't feel like uh what I've got to say isn't very interesting. A lot of people I talk to make that mistake and I dig in and then it turns out they've solved something, you know, that's either very different you've never really heard of or it's something that actually everyone needs to solve and there's a big chunk of people that haven't figured it out yet. So it's it's worth applying. And then I know the team do a great job of selecting talks as well. So the the program you get on the day is just like yeah they're like fantastic. So it's one of my favorite conferences. >> Yeah. for me as well. I I was uh there last year and I had a really great time to meet not only just uh graphinistas but also the uh some amazing people from community who I never like only doing chat or just on GitHub but yeah it's it's a fun place and a lot of exciting things happen plus I also want to highlight about the uh golden uh growth awards we have this category as well so basically it means if you have a dashboard which you feel like hey this is really useful and it has all the right values. Uh you can apply to this category as well and we will have a uh like a selection of like top uh one of the uh top picks from the dashboard category and if you are lucky you can win this uh uh award as well. So last year we have uh two winners because I think we do in two categories right? Uh I forgot the name but I remember we have two categories. Does anyone know the name of those categories? >> I know a chat GPT that might. >> I just don't type fast enough. But yeah, that that is very fun. And they win them for like you can win them for like the best dashboard, personal dashboard and professional dashboard. Is it that? >> Yeah, correct. Yeah, I should have also clicked. See see Matt, sometimes uh we rely too much on AI. Yeah. [laughter] >> Yeah. Actually AI does all my scrolling for me now. >> Yeah. Uh yeah, I wish I I uh um um I I am still like uh uh never been in this category uh uh as a panelist. Uh but this is a really fun category because the dashboards are really like sometimes feels out of this world or some sometime it feels like hey this is what I am I should have made. So definitely try out this category as well if you're interested or you can do the talks as well and obviously if you are there you can not only just present your talk but also meet us attend the other sessions. Uh as KL said there's a science lab uh again uh we are planning uh for next year as well. So that will be also pretty cool. >> Yeah are the panelists people that judge it or the people that put the panels on the dashboard? And by the way, yeah, the two categories are personal dashboard and professional dashboard. Not why I thought originally professional dashboard and unprofessional dashboard. That's different. We don't have a category for that yet. >> I I I will I would like actually that category. I I I I have a lot of unprofessional dashboard which are still used as professional way. So that can fit. [laughter] >> Let's do it. >> Yeah. But it is it is a fun conference. I'll just say that. We >> do a fun song. Yeah. Nice. Um, do we have anything else which we want to talk discuss or just say something? >> Hold on. I think I think I think Matt hasn't talked about his future. >> I mean I mean he sort of has throughout this call. >> Yeah, the I mean I am so focused on assistant I'm just going to be boring about that. But uh I don't know if this is announced or not but maybe we'll leak something which is that we are going to put assistant we're going to make it available in graphana open source it'll still be running in cloud it'll still be a cloud feature but available everywhere um because yeah particularly like if if you're new to graphana and you need to learn new concepts or if you're coming from different observability platform or creating your own hobby projects like part of the science fair talks. Having assistant there to help you do that is um is just so useful cuz the LLM like it's it's such a good use case for it. Not only is it got good instincts for graphana because of all the open source stuff, but you think about like you've got your telemetry data and then it's queries to access that and then it's just the LLMs can generate those queries through natural language and then as well because they're aic they can follow up from things they see. So as they it allows them to investigate things and and we've added tools so that you can do dashboarding. So you can ask it to just create me a dashboard that shows the top five most important things for monitoring CFKA and you get like a sensible default cuz like it knows based on what it's learned in the community what things you should care about when it comes to CFKA and of course it you know it doesn't get everything perfect. So that's why you can just keep chatting with it just iterate with it and you still stay in control. So yeah, I think we've seen, you know, it's been very, it's been very helpful. We we're thrilled with how many people have told us that it's really helped helped them do their jobs and do their jobs more quickly. Um, as well as like new people using it that could only really use dashboards before because obviously everyone can use everyone can look at dashboard. It makes sense. Uh, but beyond that, you know, they weren't going to go and edit queries. They weren't writing and running their own queries to look at the data slightly differently. But now they can. [clears throat] you can ask those questions and the LLM will generate the queries for you and render them. Um, so yeah, I do think it's like one of the one of the use cases of LLMs that I think really fits nicely and the future uh for next year, you know, because we've done the we have investigations which is where we swarm all the agents over telemetry to kind of try and debug things um and find yeah find issues that it it might it might notice. and they they all run concurrently and they they also are agentic each one. So like that as a capability and like different ways to do that you can do like a quick shallow pass at things. what can we learn every time we run that there are things that we learn and how do we then have a memory you know inside your instance how do we then have that memory so that next time it's much faster all these kinds of things I think they're just going to be next year is going to be very different for I think observability when it comes to yeah interacting with it accessing it and automating things that that are otherwise total and and the the the idea is it frees you up so that you have more time then to think about what's next and that's where I feel like we're going to start to see the advantage. So yeah, I'm excited about that. >> I I think this this is definitely a very big news because I already got asked in some community forums by users like if the graphana assistant can be also available in the open source part but now now you announce it as a leak. Uh >> yeah, it's a leak announcement. >> Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. >> Yeah. So it's just for people who watch this. It's exclusive. >> Yeah, cool. >> I just use it to search, you know, like when whenever I'm looking for a dashboard. Um and uh but I noticed I was just using it today. Um if the if the normal dashboard search comes back empty, you now have a button to just click and then it makes the assistant go. That's pretty cool. >> Yeah, you're going to see more and more of that I think of like but we're not crowbaring it in. And we're also quite late to the game here because we didn't want to ship AI for the sake of it. So, we really, really, really waited until there was something that was special. And I think like that having that high standard, I think, is important because there is so much AI slop and there's so much hype that I can see why people are just like, "Okay, you just figure it out and let me know when something works." And that's I think what we're saying is this is actually useful AI. That's our motto. Yeah. >> But it is good. >> When was the last time When was the last time you used a real crowbar? A real crowbar. >> I don't think I've ever ever [laughter] used an actual crowbar. >> Me never actually. >> Monkey Island maybe. I played Monkey Island back [laughter] in as a kid. I think at one point he uses a crowbar. >> Do you have a crowbar? Does anyone have a crowbar? >> I think I might have one. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Have you used it then? >> Yeah, I have. [laughter] >> Yeah. You use it to get nails out, you know. >> Yeah. The other side of a hammer does that I suppose as well, doesn't it? >> Yeah. Yeah. You know, [clears throat] sometimes need a bigger hammer. >> Yeah. >> A tradesman came to our flat and he's like, "Oh, sorry. My hammer's in the in the car. Can I borrow you a hammer?" And I'm like, "Yeah, sure you can. Here you go." And he said, "I've never seen a hammer in such good condition." Like, [laughter] he said, "Even when they're brand new from the shop, they're not like they haven't been looked after this well. I just never used it. Never never used it. Not very handy around the house, >> but it it is always uh good to keep at least one MR. Uh you never know. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Also, you you don't need to use it. >> True. You can just keep it and look at it on the shelf. It looks nice. You look handy. Look Makes you look more butch, which I I need. >> Yeah. Just a hammer on the shelf. I'm like, what that? Just my hammer. Yeah, I'll do that. But you never know. You're right. You never know when you're going to need it, it has been. Although, be careful Christmas Eve because remember if Santa comes down the chimney, leave the hammer on the mantle piece. It's just Santa. >> Yeah. Or or I can replace the hammer with with with a different hammer, like a Thor hammer. So, like, hey, that's that's my hammer. You know, it has magical powers as well. [laughter] >> That's that Well, if I had a Thor hammer, I would have that on the wall. Yeah, for sure. [laughter] If I had like a real one like from Thor >> then. Yeah. Yeah. >> For that. >> Oh, sorry. Sorry. No, no, I was just saying like for for for real one, we have to we have to uh make some calls or maybe pitch Griffane that that person in a way like he said, "Yes, get my hammer. >> Get my hammer. Fetch the hammer." >> No, but it's not it's not I don't No matter how much we try and get hammers to take off as a thing, USman, I don't I don't think we're doing it. Um, I just think that the hammer nails him. >> So, but Carl, in in Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol, the he's [clears throat] visited by the three ghosts, >> they scare him because they show him like you're not very you weren't very nice, Penny Pincher. In the past, you were you lost a love. In fact, um, not you, Carl, but the Scrooge, you lost a love. So, they take him back and remind him of that. It's Christmas past. Christmas Present is talking about generosity and things and shows times when he hasn't he's not doing that and the impact of that. Bob Cratchet Tiny Tim's not doing great. I'll tell you that. And then in the Christmas future um show death takes him and just points and just like there's your grave mate and look no one comes to your funeral or if they do they're only coming to try and steal the coins off your eyes. So a very tragic demise for old Scrooge. He sees that vision. When he then wakes up, it's Christmas morning. He's not sure if it's a dream or not. Um, you know, but I don't I don't believe in ghosts. But those spirits scared him. And uh and then he was a changed man. So he took a big turkey. He's like, "Hey boy, get me that turkey." Yeah, that one. Take it to Tiny Tim's house. I don't know where he lives. Tiny Tim. Who's that? Yeah, you can't just say that because there's loads of people in London. Even at that time, the population was massive. But in the book was like, "Yeah, sure." They go around and everything's good. So, it was redeemed. Carl, you now you've been grumpy. You're forced forced to finance people to use your tech that is not good enough. >> Mhm. >> You You're talking about forcing all the schemer on everyone and they don't get a choice about whether it's a bull or a string. [laughter] You just have to insist. So, that's your evil. Are you redeemed? Is there something you're now changed? Do you have to now be changed for this to work? [snorts] >> Oh, tricky question. Do I feel redeemed? Am I redeemed? Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Like I we want to focus more on making it easier to build on top of Kana. I think that's my answer. I think that's the answer here for my view. >> Yeah. >> That's it. That's the equivalent of helping Tiny Tim with his medical bills and paying Bob Cratchet's mortgage. helping people do that. So that's there we go. It's a happy ending. God blesses everyone. >> Yeah. So uh so yeah, I think that's [laughter] >> we had a very long pause. Yeah. >> Yeah. I know. Are they my favorite bits after I've talked the long pauses? >> Yeah. >> Merry Christmas. No, I think no, I think we we we we had a really great episode also today. So yeah, thank you everyone. I again want to thank you the whole Graphana community or we actually want to thank you the whole Graphana community and also I personally want to thank all these three individuals here because uh we really had a really exciting year again in 2025 and obviously 2026 is will be much better more exciting than this one. You know, Grafana, we are always creating and making something new, improving something and making for the community. So, enjoy your holidays. Uh be safe. Uh drink and eat a lot. Enjoy the time with your friends and family. And we will see you in the next year. Till then, take care. Bye-bye. >> Bye holidays everyone. Happy holidays. >> Happy holidays.
