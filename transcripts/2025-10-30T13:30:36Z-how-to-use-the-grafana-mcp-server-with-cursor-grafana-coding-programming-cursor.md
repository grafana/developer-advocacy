## Summary

In this video, the speaker demonstrates the functionality of Grafana, a data visualization and monitoring tool, by refreshing their local instance to check its performance and panel displays. They showcase various metrics such as total request rates, active users, request rates over time, and by endpoint, which are generated from fake traffic for demonstration purposes. The speaker emphasizes the utility of Grafana, particularly when managing multiple servers, by exploring its capabilities in querying data from instances, specifically highlighting the interaction with a microphone instance.

## Chapters

Sure! Here are the key moments from the transcript provided:

00:00:00 Introduction to the livestream  
00:00:30 Refreshing the Grafana dashboard  
00:01:00 Overview of created tags in Grafana  
00:01:30 Checking if the panels are working  
00:02:00 Displaying total request rates and active users  
00:02:30 Analyzing request rate over time  
00:03:00 Request rate by endpoint explained  
00:03:30 Generating fake traffic for the demo  
00:04:00 Importance of metrics in a multi-MCP server setup  
00:04:30 Asking about capabilities of a specific microphone instance

I'm here in my local Grafana, and let's see if it works right. Let me refresh. Here it is! It even created some tags. 

Now, let's check if the panels are working because sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't. We need to tweak them occasionally. 

Here we have:
- Total request rates
- Active users
- Request rate over time
- Request rate by endpoint

This is all for my demo, where I'm generating fake load and fake traffic. It read the metrics and created the visualizations. 

One thing that's really useful, especially if you have multiple MCP servers, is directly asking, "What can you do?" In this case, "What can you do with the microphone instance?"

uh and let's see if it works right uh so I'm here in my local graphana let me refresh uh here it is even created some some tags and now let's see if the panel panels are working because sometimes they do sometimes they don't and we need to tweak sometimes but here it is we have total request rates and active users and request rate over time and request rate by endpoint and this is all for my demo here where I'm generating fake uh load fake traffic but it it read the matrix and created and here it is and one thing that it's really useful even especially if you have multiple MCP servers is like directly asking uh what can you do uh in this case what can you do with microphone instance
