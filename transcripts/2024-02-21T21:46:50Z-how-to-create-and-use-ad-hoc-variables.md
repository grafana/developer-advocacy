Transcript: following up with rudolf's question here's a quick explanation and example on how to use an ad hoc variable first here we have a couple of dashboard panels being populated from an influx DB data source a word of advice ad hoc variables will work with data sources that you are already using in your dashboard so for that we're going to go to the settings and create a new ad hoc variable we will name it let's say VAR ad hoc and then we're going to select the data source that is already being used in the dashboard once we have it my adhoc will appear in the top of our dashboard from it we can select some different elements that we have here and we will see that the dashboard automatically updates with ad hoc variables the changes are automatically applied to your visualization panels so there you have it a quick and easy example that you can follow to create and use your ad hoc variables
