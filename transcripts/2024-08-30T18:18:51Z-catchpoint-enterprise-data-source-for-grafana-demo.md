Transcript: I'm T Kim a software engineer on the Enterprise data sources team at Graal Labs I'm excited to show you a new plugin catch Point let me give you a quick tour of the catcho plugin to start off I'll go to connections data sources catch Point simply you can name your plugin and then set up the token I'll say I hit the saving test the button and then once you pass the plugin is ready to use uh I'll go to dashboard um I have set up um demo dashboard uh for catch point I have three queries here test query SLO query and ROM query which are currently supported I'll check the test query first uh you can select uh which quy U which test quy to be sent and then there are eight parameters that can be passed for example I can select three metrics here and then sending that will only return those metrics that you selected here another interesting parameter here is that subsource type uh if you are interested in uh seeing the metrics related to request then you can select that request in the parameter and then sending another query will return all the metrics related to request so that was a test query and then next up is a SL query SL queries consist of two uh query ypes first SLO list and the other one is SLO status SLO list basically pulls a lot of properties of the active SLO that you have in your catcho platform um if I check if I open up the transformation I'm only showing name and goal from the first uh editor and then you can merge uh the other uh metric which is current that's coming from assetto status uh so that's why you see name and goal and current and those are the percentage uh of the table in uh one uh visualization panel and then next is a ROM query um currently you have to manually type your site ID uh if you don't want to type manually type it all the time you can make use of uh template variable that comes with the uh grafana so for example I have site ID that I set up up here and then you can select um uh those template variable and then sending it will uh grab the value from the template variable up here currently I have no data but like uh the the metric uh data will be very similar to test Cory so if you have any data available it'll show quite similar to test Cory that I showed earlier thanks for listening if you're interested in learning more check out catch Point doc graph on the labs
