Transcript: so introduce yourself hello I'm Matthew Durham I work on the alloy team so tell us about alloy what exactly is new how different is it from agent is it agent rebranded or what so it's very similar to agent flow mode so if you've used that it's mostly the same if you're coming from agent static it's very different so kind of depends on where you're coming from okay so what what else is there anything different other than the name so I think one of the big things we're doing is we now have a stability guarantee so before hand when you upgraded you could introduce braking changes but now as long as the major version doesn't change we promise that there won't be any braking changes with a few exceptions okay and do you recommend that people now just go straight to alloy rather than agent absolutely in fact in 95% of the cases you can drop in the old agent flow config directly into alloy and it will just work awesome thanks man
