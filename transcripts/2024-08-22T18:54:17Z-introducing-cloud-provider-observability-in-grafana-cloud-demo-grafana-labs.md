Transcript: Hello, I'm Ana Ivanov, a software
engineer at Grafana Labs, and I'm excited to tell you today about
the new Cloud Provider Observability application available in public
preview in Grafana Cloud. This new application provides a
unified monitoring solution across AWS, Azure and GCP. It simplifies the management
of observability in cloud
environments by providing an overview of your connected data
for each cloud provider with automatic service detection. Because this application
comes with out-of-the-box
observability dashboards for all your major cloud providers telemetry, multi-cloud observability
has never been easier. Each cloud provider is easy to set up
and comes with comprehensive and easy to manage scraping instructions. For Azure instrumentation
for metrics and logs is easy. By setting up Grafana alloy, you get out-of-the-box dashboards for
services such as Azure SQL database, Elastic Pool, Service Bus, and much more. Similarly for GCP, you can spin it up easily and get your
insights on your Google Cloud SQL, Pub/sub or Google Cloud storage. Our agentless solution for AWS follows a
streamlined approach towards collecting and configuring your AWS data. Easily get your data in Grafana Cloud
by connecting to your AWS account and then choosing the
services you want to monitor. Pick which metrics you want to scrape
and optionally define custom namespaces and tag your data. You
can then monitor EC2, RDS or billing and more services by
using the application's dashboards. The app includes automatic
service detection. You can view metrics and dashboards for
supported services through automatic detection to ensure your services are
monitored from the moment they are deployed. This feature saves you countless
hours and keeps you on top of new infrastructure without
manual intervention. Finally, the dedicated Log views feature for
each cloud provider enables users to troubleshoot issues more effectively, significantly reducing
mean time to resolution. We're really excited about
this new experience and we
want you to use it and let us know if you have any
feedback. Thank you.
