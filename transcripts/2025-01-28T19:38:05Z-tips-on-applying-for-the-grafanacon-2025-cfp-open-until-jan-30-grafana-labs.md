Transcript: Hi, everyone. I'm Mihaela Maior. My name is Carl Bergquist. I was very excited to work alongside Carl
last year to bring you an awesome event. And hopefully this one
will be bigger and better. Community presentation at GrafanaCONs
is very important for us because we want to be honest with the users who
are using our product and not just us pushing our ideas and motivations. We want to see that our users show others. How our products can be used. This is an opportunity for us to
connect, share feedback, learn from each other and also for the community
to demonstrate to us how they're using what we're building for bigger purposes
than probably we've ever imagined. So this year we are really
keen on seeing people solving complex problems with Grafana. And we're also very keen on seeing
people using multiple of our open source projects together. And we are also very keen on seeing
non-traditional use cases of Grafana. We are also very keen on seeing
Grafana being used at large scale. when we see these large installations
serving very important needs in our society, that makes
us very, very, very proud. Anyone and everyone that's passionate
about observability or uses any of our open source projects. We are very much interested in
experienced speakers and this is actually something that we ask as part
of the CFP, but we're very welcoming to first time speakers as well. This can be a launchpad, right? An opportunity for you to put
yourself out there and show the expertise that you have. Yeah, so some tips for those
considering applying to our CFP, first of all, think about your
value proposition to the audience. It's a privilege to be on stage at
this event, especially this year because it's single track, right? And we want to be very intentional
with the learning opportunities or what we offer to our
audience through these sessions. So think about that. on top of this, as a judge, it makes it
so much easier for me to, you know, to score talks if they have enough details. So consider an outline for your
talk outcomes, you know, and what is it that you're trying to put out
there on the stage for our audience, for your community colleagues. Additionally, we do give you the
option to give us an example of you, presenting in a, in a similar setting. So use that opportunity if you
have a link, but equally, I want to shout out that we are
very welcoming to new speakers. So this is not, limited.
