Transcript: And folks, we are live now. So, uh, welcome everyone to this Grafana Campfire community call episode for the month of April. And this one is very interesting where we talk about data visualization tips and techniques. And uh we have some uh experts actually two very experts who are also the voice of the community uh which will give their intro uh briefly and uh for now I will first pass to uh David who also like to talk more on this campfire community call who is also uh doing this for a long time with KL. So David please introduce yourself and the call. Yeah thank you. Yeah, I uh I'm David. I I run the Kafana team and I really looking forward to today's topic uh data viz and sort of tips and best practices cuz um I try to keep it simple usually with uh just sort of like like um time series charts um and try to stay away from pie charts but uh but maybe there's some more but also recently we're doing more in with sort of uh BI based data sources and find myself also reaching more and more for transformations and I think we're going to hear some more about this. So I'm super excited about today's call. Uh Carl, do you want to introduce yourself? Yeah, my name is Carl Beist. Uh I'm also one of the standing hosts I guess for this call. um principle engineer been a graphana department forever and I'm very bullish on this topic because this is one of the bread and butters of graphana right like it's not just fetching data from any place is also displaying them in various different ways so this is like an ever growing part of graphana and I'm always excited to find new ways that that keeps it simple right like um one of my favorite one that we added a few years ago is state state timeline uh panel because it's like makes it so easier to see for example, when alerts are firing over time based on groups and so on. Super powerful. Christina, do you want to introduce yourself? Yeah, I'm Christina Dervage. I've been working at Graphfana for three years on the data viz team most recently. Um, you might have seen me in the community slack answering questions or taking things, writing up issues, etc. Uh, I really like doing that and yeah, I'm really excited to be able to talk about some of my favorite things, some things that maybe you don't know about or just general tips on how to use Graphana. Uh, Gayen. Hi, I'm I'm Gayen. Um, I've also been on uh here for about three years. Uh, currently on the uh logs drill down squad um working with uh Loki and Logs data sources. And yeah, favorite panel. I'm I'm a little biased, so I'm going to have to go logs panel. Um but uh to each their own. Uh yeah, so my name is Usman. I I'm working now in graphana close to three years and I work in the dev advocacy team and uh and basically working also some part of my time with the community uh sometime on slack or mostly with champions our graphana champions and for me I think the one panel which is my favorite which always work is the table panel regardless it's time series or static it always show the right data and it's up to you like how you can manipulate further beyond its uh normal default use case. So yeah. Yeah. Um so Christina uh you want to share some slide or you first talk something more uh how you feel? Yeah, I mean I can just get started on some of the slide stuff and then if you wanted to get into questions after that. Does that sound good to everybody? That sounds good. Perfect. Okay. Um I will share your slides now. Yeah. Um and I I want this to be you know if anybody has anything that they want to interject with or whatever uh feel free. Um and we'll get into some samples of things first. But uh kind of first I wanted to get in Oh, here's an introduction uh for me and Gayen again. Uh we're both actually from Minneapolis, Minnesota in the US. Um I you know got two cats and I like sewing. Uh Gayen Yeah. Hey, I have two dogs and two cats and uh I like gardening. There you go. Um so yeah, a little bit of what I wanted to talk about for this and again we'll probably move around and get cut off, but uh just the some of the best ways to get help uh when you ask questions in the graphana slack and it can also give some tips on if you are being asked for help like what you can do. And then um I got some sample stuff to kind of go through if we wanted to get into that. Um just to go over this real quick. Uh when you ask a question uh about visualizations or if you're trying to communicate to other people like what your thing is like what you're experiencing with visualizations. First off, the data source and visualization like type that you're using are both very very important. Um that can help us kind of refine down like what it is and like if we're going to look up something, we need to look up those two things. Um what version you're on is also really important and you can get that from the little question mark at the top uh right. Uh on OSS you've get the actual version of Graphana and then on Graphana Cloud there's this little steady thing. Um Graphfana Cloud uses these rolling release channels which means that the v the version is sort of tied to a cadence and but we can look that up and figure out what what release you're on. Um, again, and this is, uh, I'm saying this as a judgment free zone. Uh, if you're doing anything weird, uh, and you're coming to us with a question, it's really helpful to just sort of surface that immediately because like having a lot of transformations, having a lot of overrides, having a lot of variables. And again, I love it when people do weird things with Grafana. I do weird things with Graphfana. Please do weird things with Graphana. We want to be able to support this. But it's helpful when you're getting bugs to see that there's something a little unique going on. Can I can I just ask you Christina when do I know that I've sort of left the realm of sort of normaly and I would say yeah that's a tricky one because it's like I would say above three transformations uh you know maybe five transformations is like people uh 13 and again like this in the example I have here the person really needed to have 13 transformations like that's just something and it's not great like we want to be able to condense that down and we've got stuff coming out to kind of help with that. But, uh, just let us know and we can I mean, even if there's a bug that we fix, we can usually like use this to do a feature request of something that we can build to kind of help us everybody out here. But yeah, I'd say above five. I don't know, Gayen, if you've run into anything more than different than that, but yeah, I think it I think it depends, but yeah, 13 seems like too many. Yeah, it's a lot. I was I was I was curious what this 35 is on there. I did I did notice was the number of overrides. Yeah. Yeah. For this one, they're they're doing a lot of refining of like the widths of columns, so it's not that big of a deal, but still it's just like anything unique like that is is something to call out, but and and then uh this is all still contained in the panel JSON or or in the dashboard JSON, right? if you ever had to kind of share with someone what kind of transformations you're doing or like how do you like how can you get this to someone and for like diagnosis? Yeah, actually we can uh there's two ways that you can do this. Um when you go to the and this is like there's kind of two big categories of questions that we get. It's one of them is a very specific like I have built a thing and there's a problem with it. And in this one, you would go and there's a kebab menu in kind of the upper right. You'd go to more and get help. Um, when you do that, it pops up from the side a little preview of like what your debug panel will look like. And it's got some information on the right here of what version you're on, and that can kind of help us. Um, and then there's this panel, uh, this top left panel that shows the and this has all of the transformations. It like takes a snapshot of the data that you've got. And actually, you can use there's um some fields here to randomize that data if you want to try to make it if it's sensitive. Um and then you can send that over to us and we will um we go through and we upload it to there's this like new import thing. You can upload it and then we end up seeing um just everything that you've done. And it does have all of your transformations there too. So we can kind of then toggle that stuff um and see see what's going on. And I did want to say one thing here too. If you do do this, the nice thing to do for us is to filter down your time range to something that is small enough because you can have like this is this first example. It's the same query, but it's 72meg uh debug panel versus a 2meg debug panel if you can kind of filter your data down. And usually we don't need 30 days of data to find a bug. You can usually do it with like a just a couple days. So that's one way to to help us out if you're going to send a panel over this way. That's crazy. Do Do you remember what this what his use case was that you get 72 megs of time series? Oh, it was this was just a debug panel. I just didn't filter the data down. So, this is like a whole month of data. It's like not even that much. But it's because there's just so many rows. So, and yeah, but once you do have something where it's a lot of data over a long period of time, these can get like you start sending stuff and hitting rate limits and it's not not great. Absolutely. I did want to talk to just real quick. Uh the other category of questions that we get are more of a like I have broader like I have this data. I want it to look like this. I don't know what I'm you know I don't know anything about how do you how do you make something look like this? And from that you can export out your C your data as a CSV. Um and this is by going into your query inspector. There's a download CSV button. You click that and you just get CSV. And so then you can open that up. Um you there's no sanitize option here. You'd have to do that yourself. And again like cutting it down to, you know, 10 rows or whatever it's best to show that and then you can just send that CV CSV over. Um if you're not familiar, uh there's a data source called test data. And in test data, there's a bunch of different scenarios you can go through. like it it comes with some CSVs that you can upload but there's also a CSV content scenario where you can just copy paste a CSV right in there and it's been really really helpful for debugging questions like these where people are just like I have this data make it look a certain way u and that's how you would do that if you ever are wanting to kind of play with graphana without having to connect it to a data source um does that Yeah, absolutely. Uh Christina, uh uh sorry, I I I actually somehow my my internet cut off uh in the previous example about the transformation. uh I don't know uh if this question came up but uh I think many folks in the community have this uh perception that uh they love using transformation u as well uh and uh but they don't know like what's its advantage and what is its disadvantage can you maybe uh describe this in like a twoliner thing like when to use transformation and when not to use transformation yeah I think transformations are super powerful ful when a query language when you're limited by your query language to make you know data look a certain way like graphana visualizations they have an expectation of what they want data to look like to be able to display them and query language you know when you query a a database data source and you get it back that data source might have its own opinions on what it wants the data to come back to you like and the query might not make that so simple to manipulate. So transformations are really really good at being able to take data from however you know Graphana's big thing is we take data in from wherever it lives but you know then we can make it look the way that Graphana needs or some way that Graphana can expect to be able to visualize it. Um that said you know the limitation I got have a little bit of this too um with the thing with um transformations is they are all ran client side right now. We've got some stuff to work on this, but right now they're all client side. So the not great time to use visual or transformations are the time to kind of think about how you want to build your dashboard is just to make it optimized. Um like you can optimize stuff, you know, your your data source databases have a bunch of stuff to optimize storage, your API, you can generally do things to optimize that transformations, you know, they're running on your computer uh with everything else that's running on your computer. And so if you're going through a big chunk of data and you're running like a transformation that will like pivot a table or manipulate the data really a lot that can really slow down your dashboard um and your just your browser will have a very bad time. So I kind of think of it like this. If you can cut, if you can aggregate your data, like if you have control of your API and you can aggregate your data coming from the API, that will help everything downstream from your transformation will have less to to turn through and your visualization will have will be more performant as well. Um, that said too, if you're if you can't do that, if you don't have control of your API, you're kind of stuck with what it looks like. If you can filter your data, if you can put a transformation in that filters your data first and then do a lot of the the heavier processing transformations after, then it's going through less data basically and the again you're might have a better performance uh of your thing. So um yeah, does that kind of answer your question for when to use both? Yeah. Yeah, I think uh it makes sense and uh what I also understand that using a lot of transformation is actually expensive. Uh when you query your result uh uh maybe it costs you some some good amount of money if you are have a cloud data. Uh most of folks like don't understand this. So that's why I I I I wanted to uh brought this question so that everyone knows like when to use and when not to use transformation. Thank you. Right. Yeah. Yeah. No, if your query if your a if like whatever service provider you're using is like charging you based on how much you get back, you're going to want to filter that so you get less back and get charged less. Um versus getting all of the data and then filtering it in a transformation. You're kind of that it's just money that is going to them. This is also one of those things that we always had in Grafana where we do some maybe calculations in the front end and maybe your data source done something in the back end and this might actually mean that the thing you're looking at is not really correct because if you ask the data source to do average over something and then in graphana front end we do average over those data points as well you're at a point where you do average of averages which is not correct right it might be good enough for your use case uh which is fine That is something to keep in mind that unless you put all the data, it might not be correct. But yeah. Yep. Absolutely. It's good to balance everything and and know what know what's happening. So yeah, what's up next? Do we want to go through some examples? Do we have questions from the audience? Yeah. Um maybe we can get some we can post some questions. Uh maybe the first one from the audience. Um let me paste. So So the question which we got is that is there a way to display the same panel in multiple different dashboards? Yeah, I think there's a couple options for this. Um, if you don't mind, several instances of the same. Um, did you could you go to where I'm sharing my screen real quick? This one, the slides or the other one? The other one. Okay, thank you. Um, hopefully everybody can see this. This is some sample stuff, but if you needed to ever like just copy something uh copy a panel to use a different dashboard, you can hit the copy button here. I'm going to just I'll go through here, new dashboard, and then you can paste the panel this way. Um, this does though it does mean when you edit the one and then you edit the other one, they are separate. Uh, so you can't then reflect like you'd have to edit both of them if you wanted to change both of them. Um, but then you know it does copy all of the the settings, all of the data and everything that you have for that. Um, the other way, and I haven't done a ton of this, but uh, there's this thing with library panels where you can save things in the library and then um, again, this is not one of the things that I use super often, but um, you can use a like a live from a live from the library panel and start your panel that way. Um, that's the two ways that I know of doing it. I don't know if anybody else has any other experience with um having the same panel in multiple dashboards. Yeah, I think uh I have the same experience like you can use library panels uh so that that dashboard is also available within your team members because graphana has this uh uh role management uh uh control as well. So uh you can share that dashboard uh or panel uh I would say uh and the other is which I know is like copy or use as a duplicate. Um yeah the the panel library that's a new thing uh that's that's not that's been around for I don't know like a couple of months right? Um it feels kind of new to me. Um I haven't I haven't used it yet but I think it's also a bit similar to something that we've been doing internally at Grafana in the beginning which was just use just to use uh provisioning. So not even going through the UI but using JSON and then another language called JSON it to produce um exactly the same panels for various dashboards and then just managing that um in an S code manner right and then just yeah using provisioning to make sure that all those panels are the same but that's maybe a bit like one step further than um than this whole UI way here. That's possible now. All right. Uh I'll read this one. We're in need of a dashboard variable which can read the same information from multiple data sources. Now when we create a dashboard variable for example Kubernetes cluster name using a value label value from so yeah I think they're looking for a I think it continues with cube state metrics and we have four plus data sources for metrics. Yeah I don't think we can do a dashboard query that comes from multiple like that have to be a feature request. So, we could write something up for you with that one, but I don't we can't do dashboard variables from multiple data sources right now. Unfortunately, to ma to me that kind of sounds like uh a centralized observability solution could be your answer to that where you ship all of the metrics to one place instead of having four different sources of metrics. As at least as long as you want to query across uh those clusters, right? The way we done that historically is to have a dashboard with a data source variable. So then you would uh pick uh what cluster you want to read from and then you would see more of the metrics from within that cluster based on the first one. Yeah. So you'd set this and you'd say yeah like a just show me all of your Prometheus data sources and then yeah something like that but not exactly what you're looking for but it could see it be being helpful. So we got I think one one other question as well. I'm seeing or or Gayen you want to read out this one out loud. Sure. I'm seeing lots of Kubernetes operators that come with monitoring dashboards in the repos. And it looks like another two-parter. Yeah. What are the ways that I can consume them? I I can take that one. So So there's actually not a straightforward answer to that question right now. uh it's something we're considering in the future of of reading from the Kubernetes API to discover these type of entities and then inserting them into a sh like a central graphana solution or multiple graphana solutions. It's not something we have today. So depending on how they are stored in the operator, you would have to read them and then send them to Graphana by yourself right now. But we're very aware of that uh problem and we're going to work on it very soon or yeah many things in in the pipeline but we we hear your problem that's for sure. Thank you. Thank you KL and uh I will also read this question out loud. I think this is something very close to a lot of new graphana and even experienced graphana user that struggle like uh uh using dashboard after importing and exporting. So what is the correct way to fix a dashboard if it does not work after uh importing it while the same dashboard works on the previous version of graphana. So I think the question is more like if you have a dashboard maybe using graphana 10 let's say and now you have a graphana 11 and the same dashboard if you uh import it it may not work as expected. So any tips here? I would just probably look at seeing if there's been a bug logged um about it. I know that when we do things, there's usually migration steps that are in the documentation for when a new version gets released. You know, that said, we can't we don't always catch everything, unfortunately. But there's like there, you know, for the the panel that's having problems trying to do a search for uh that panel in our repository. Um maybe doing more of an incremental upgrade to C is another thing, but um I haven't done a lot of this directly. So I don't know if anybody else has other experience. Yeah, I mean this this really depends a lot on a lot of different variables as to what is the thing that's causing the dashboard to break. Um I've seen this a lot with like some of the community dashboards that I've imported on my home lab. Um you know, maybe they were built for an older version of Graphana. Um I think the big one that probably impacted a lot of people was kind of the deprecation and moving away from Angular. So a lot of those dashboards that were created you know for Grafana 8 and much older just need need a little bit of work to to work with modern graphana and it's too bad that a lot of those dashboards are out there. Maybe people still have them running on their instances, but uh hopefully the if it is a community dashboard, you should just find where you got that from initially and hopefully that those people have provided a newer one that works with a a modern version of Graphana. Yeah, thanks Kalin. And I think uh this also brings a very good uh point uh for for discussion um that like if someone who's uh even using graphana for a long time maybe does not know the exact right resources like where to uh find uh report an issue or uh report a problem or feature requests and so on. Uh I know Christina you have this also in the uh you wanted to talk about this more so uh I give stage back to you. Yeah. Did you wanna could you flip to my slides real quick? Sorry to make you always flip around here. Um there's a prepared slides for this too somewhere. Um yeah, right here. This is so you know a couple resources just looking for other places to get help from. Um you know there's the forum, there's the Slack that I'm always in. Um we have our documentation which is always super comprehensive. Uh, and then for if you need to kind of dig in a little bit, two things that I recommend doing. Um, we have labels in our repository. So the graphana graphana repo is the open source stuff. Um, we have labels for every single type of panel and every single type of data source. So looking for issues that are open or even the closed ones um for with the label of that panel type or that data source type. Um, if it's an open issue, uh, you know, you might be able to see some talk about from the developers on like people trying to diagnose or or repro it. Um, and a lot of these too, even the closed ones, you can see where people have found workarounds and we'll post about that in our our open issues or closed issues. Um, and yeah, if you're on kind of stuck on an older version and it was fixed, you can at least find the closed issue and know that the the fix is out there and coming and what you need to update to to to get that fixed. So yeah, but that's the looking up the like a lot of times when I can see a bug, the first thing I do is I'll do a search in Graphana Graphana for like kind of an overview. Um maybe I have to find down the labels and see if everybody people have found that problem and what the solutions are. But just real quick to this original question, right, like what to do when an imported dashboard looks broken, right? I feel like you always have for each of the panels you you have two options, right? Either the panel is somehow broken because it's an outdated panel type. For I feel like for the for the Angular ones, I think we're showing something now. So that at least that you're alerted to uh that you're trying to use an Angular based plug-in panel, but it's no longer supported. So then I think you can just switch out to a different visualization and then you should be able to see this thing. Uh what I also sometimes like to do is when I when I when I know the panel should be working or there should be data that I switch over to the table panel because then you see essentially the like the raw data. Um if you switch over to the table panel and you still don't see any data, then there's probably something wrong with your data source. So then I would I'm not really sure how how we're detecting the data sources that you then have, right? Because maybe they're named differently on this imported panel uh that you then just switch to your own data source essentially, right? And then you should have data show up. And if that's not working, then I would I would probably try and just enable that uh and just switch over to that test data source just to see if you if if you can show something, right? And then kind of take it from there and rebuild it step by step, right? Like try to rebuild the query, see if it renders on a table panel and then show it on your favorite visualization and then you can go um sort of across all the all the panels on the on the broken dashboard. It sounds a bit tedious, but um uh some of the some of the queries that come with those community panels, I think they're quite valuable, right? Because someone figured out how to write the best query to observe something, right? Like my SQL or something. And so I think it's worth kind of retaining a bit of this. And that's my Yeah. And I think and I think uh one major uh factor could be the version uh uh version like maybe you uh the the dashboard which may be available uh in the graphana catalog or marketplace maybe using MySQL older version and the current user may have a different version. So version difference also matters on the data source site as well. Maybe uh the queries are not working or not supported because that particular variable or clause does not exist. So uh that you have to also keep in mind because in our graphana uh dashboard marketplace uh if you trying to import a dashboard uh you probably see in the on the like uh in the details like which kind of Prometheus version or maybe MySQL version this dashboard was built for. So uh if you see there's a mismatch uh then there's some chances that it may not work as expected. Yeah, I think I think we had this problem with Elastic for a while, right? Like because they had so many different versions and introduced uh more and more sort of query um uh sort of query words that could be combined differently and uh that definitely needs to be checked. Um yeah. Um Galen, did you work a bit with the elastic data source? a a little bit. Um, but that went to another squad right when I started working with logs. Yeah, that's cool. All right, you um we have more questions, right? Yeah. Uh, so we got one question. So, uh, this is again from the community. Uh, so what is your favorite panel in Graphana and why? Is it a standard panel or not? So uh the question is very broad. Um so Galen or Christina you want to take or I think it it it more sounds like also like our self opinion like which one we prefer or or in general what should be a standard look like? Yeah. I think for me I mean I think somebody else said this too but the table panel just because it's so you can get everything on it. You don't have to worry about formatting it. Just here's what your data looks like. Uh, and you can, you know, when you play around with some of the transformations to make your data look fun, you can get some, you can do color, you know, colors for status stuff. I don't know. I love a t table panel. It's great. Yeah, I'll always I'll always second a table panel uh plug there. Um but uh something I really liked was the the use of the horizontal uh uh bar gauge. Um um Christine and I were at a a local graphana meetup here. Somebody had these really quite quite using the the retro LCD panel and kind of just built all their dashboard around that theme. um really was kind of aesthetically pleasing but also um for their specific use case of kind of showing like uh you know kind of like percentages of like Wi-Fi connection or battery status and stuff worked really well to at a glance know which devices you know needed to get swapped out or we're having connectivity issues and but yeah so I think the answer to this really depends on your use case but I think that's why maybe table gets the win just because it's so generic that um it's usually the the first step in whatever your use case happens to be. Yeah, I think um this also implies like how not only just your use case uh uh how you are designing your dashboard panel. So um uh uh for folks who are want to learn more about like dashboard design guides, we do have a webinar which is totally uh free to join and it runs like uh frequently. I think there was one yesterday which I also um talk a little bit about dashboard design. So it depends on the design like like what Galen said that it if it is something maybe for a device. So showing uh the data in LCD is actually a good thing because then you can set the levels like the threshold levels like when it is good, bad or going uh totally weird and um not every panel should be time series panel. I think it it should be something which shows uh more human readable. So if you have a temp you're monitoring temperature so maybe use a gauge or or similar and but if you're are monitoring something maybe server statuses on on your AWS regions so maybe stat panel or uh geo uh geo geom map panel I believe that is how it is called so you can use something similar like that so yeah that that's my college. You want to go first? I I think I'm going to stick to state timeline panel and like I can tell a little bit of story about why and and if you if you use the Prometheus alerts time series for that one, you're going to see when alerts fire or not. And if you just look at that in a time series view, you're going to see bumps. Absolutely. But once you look at in the state timeline series, you can see how frequently they alert and how they group up with other alerts. So if the web fronts and database are alerting at the same time, it's very easy to see that in that panel. And and I like when you the human brain is very smart, right? It's really good at detecting patterns. Uh and sometimes the the best panels they just make those um like those things visible. It doesn't have to tell you what. It just makes sure that it will be contained in that panel if um if possible and then the human brain does the rest. I think that's what we should aim for when designing the profound dashboards. David. Yeah. No, no, absolutely. I mean, I do I do have a history with the locks panel because I I wrote the first version and now it's been sort of completely rewritten and it's finally fast and performant. So, I'm super grateful, but it's no longer my panel. But, um I feel like last year we also saw just a lot of creativity around the canvas panel, which just allows you to just to like essentially draw any kind of shape and connect it to values. And there's some pretty cool demos around uh like photo and photo wall tag setups and all that stuff. Um but the most of most I was blown away last year's Kfana um with uh this I think that was a satellite launch or something from this Japanese uh flight agency and they used uh the base 64 image panel which I didn't even know existed but this essentially just allows you to just draw anything right that you can sort of turn into an image and uh and so They in real time showed how the satellite was oriented as it was sort of going up into space and I thought that was just really cool to see that sort of side by side with also the sort of normal telemetry around it. That was pretty cool. Actually when SpaceX did their first launch they used graphana as well or at least we seen picture of graphana being used and I talked to some of the developers uh at that project and they have created their own panel that which they never shared but they use Google Earth uh in a panel and then you could see the rocket following uh the earth in that panel. Very niche use case though so like I'm not sure we're going to get a lot of people using that but that was really nice. It sounds also very exciting like the panel is following as well like very cool. Yeah. Okay. Um we we have one question which is really interesting and it's it's a uh the second part is I will speak later. Uh so do you prefer one complex dashboard or a set of small dashboard with the data links between each other? What is the best use best case for making one complex dashboard? What is the best use case for using a set of dashboard with the data links? So I think the question is more about like when using data links uh uh should we use uh one big complex dashboard or we distribute it uh among small ones I can I can take I can take this one you start yeah so if you have something that you're observing that has a sort of natural hierarchy right like a cluster and a set of nodes it's definitely useful to use data links to have kind of an overview dashboard of your cluster and then you want to list I don't know maybe the nodes in a table or something and then those can have a link to a note dashboard um and that's also been one of the first dashboards that I built in this just immediately comes to mind but I think it just matches this pattern so well because if you were to also render like let's say all the nodes individually as rows or something on the same dashboard. Uh this is going to this is going to bound to like blow up your system or sort of the your screen because it's unbounded ultimately, right? And but with the data links, you could have the node dashboard set up in a way that the nodes also become a template variable and so you you get to a very reusable dashboard of the sort of detail view of the node. Um but I think there's another when you so talk about complexity there's another use case which is we have a few operational dashboards that also have an overview but then they they hide kind of other aspects of that system uh in within rows further down right so like uh like let's say the overview has your your sort of like top level red metrics but then in the lower uh areas you would hide uh uh complexities around the read the the read path, complexities around the bright path or around uh like sort of system usage. And so there's a lot of things that you maybe not need to look at right away when you try to determine the state of your system, but it's still the same system, right? That's why it makes sense to be on the same dashboard. I hope that makes sense. That's my approach, Carl. uh pretty much echo everything you say there. Uh my primary use case for graphana is um like application observability and infrastructure monitoring and in those cases like I rather have small dashboards and navigate between them because it's just like how my brain uh picks up the things I see quicker. the more things on a dashboard uh the more things my need brain need to take account at the same time and and and unless I have to know all the things at the same time then I rather have multiple smaller dashboards um and like start from the top going down in importance so maybe the top row is just like red or green that's fine you're like do I need to keep looking at this D or not that that's that's a perfect thought um when it comes to monoliths it's sometimes useful to just keep scrolling, right? Because you're never going to get get around uh some of the patterns. I think that can also give like a direction for things to look at. Um so it's a little bit depending on use cases. So internally uh we also have like our SLO reporting that we get every Monday everyone in engineering and that dashboard is massive and that's a good use case of like a long dashboard not just because we have lots of SLOs's but it's like not something I need to look at and grasp things quickly. I want to I I want to take time to scroll through it. So it's it very depends on the use case. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's I think there's something around the workflow, right? Like if you uh to determine your next step, if you have to click around, I think you're doing something wrong, right? Like you're before you can sort of determine what to do next. I think the scrolling is kind of it, right? Like you should be able to see all those things that allow you to make the next decision, right? Like, oh, I should be looking at this node or Yeah, or I should I should be looking at this resource for something. Yeah, I want to kind of follow up a little bit on those and just want to say first of all, I love this question. I think this is also like kind of just a generic question about engineering in general of like you know do I just throw it all in one spot so people don't have to hunt or uh you know spread it all over and have really individualized use cases and and I think that yeah there isn't a a simple answer to this but I think what what uh what David uh touched on a little bit there was you know your your dashboard's supposed to do something right so that structure needs to support what that dashboard's supposed to do. So, I think that there are very much use cases for, you know, having a more generalized approach, like a whole bunch of different people are using that as a starting point to branch off to something else. And if that's what that dashboard's supposed to do, it might need to be might need to have a lot of information. But, um, but really think about when you're creating and using dashboards, like what problem is this actually supposed to solve and have the structure of the dashboard really built to support that. But also, I mean, just as a general like win, having that sort of approach that David talked about where, you know, you have an overview and then the ability to drill down really kind of covers a lot of use cases without really um you know, needing to to cater uh too much. So, it's a good good place to start. Thanks. Uh thanks everyone. Um uh Gen and Christina I believe you may also have maybe like to show some demos before we uh take any other question. Uh we still have some time. So if you maybe want to show some example or something uh uh will be will be great. Yeah. Why don't you flip Can you flip to the shared screen I've got? I'm just going to go over these real quick here. um just to kind of demonstrate again this is like I was thinking about like what it would be fun to present here and it's like some of my favorite transformations um one of my favorites that is a little bit of a niche use case but I think if it is a case that you've got like if it's going to like it's one of those things like if it's if it solves your problem it's like beautiful u and that's the matrix uh grouping to matrix transformation where uh if you've got so like looking at this we've got if you've got two categories basically and a value um you can group by matrix to organize those differently. So like because this is just a big long table of you know let's pretend that there's plant A, plant B, plant C and then there's like three production methods inside of here and then there's some amount. This is just all fake data so it doesn't matter. But um you know you look at this, you've got it visualized here. You know just a b big dump. You know there's no you can mouse over it to see what the method is. But if you go in here and you say okay do this your value is the amount. It will organize everything um in just the way you know however you want to have it here. And for this one, you know, maybe this is you what interests you is having it uh where you can categorize it by the method that the plants are using, but you can also um swap this if you want to just see like what your output is by plant, like by your by your site or whatever. Um, and again, this is something that you don't use. I've never used super often, but when you've got data that fits this problem, it's just it makes so many things just so much easier. Um, so that's one of my favorite uh transformations here. Um, I wanted to talk a little bit about mixed data sources because I think this is something that we get questions on quite a bit. Um, again, it's a little more niche too of just like especially for trying to find demos that will like actually show something. So for this and I'm not going to do this from scratch because I would I cannot do uh Jason um from scratch in front of people. Uh but for this one, I've got a mixed data source here. So you select mixed here. And what that does is if you've got multiple queries, it will open up a query. Uh on each query, you can select what data source you've got. So for this example here, I'm using an influx. Uh this is some fake data on power operations on demand. Um so I've got it here. What what is the demand of power in New York? Um, again, this is all just fake or whatever, but I've also using the Infinity data source to get JSON from a open weather database. And this is the longitude and latitude for New York. Um, and just to kind of show two here for the parser, I've got UQL, which is how you uh for Infinity can get JSON to sort of manipulate JSON data because so I don't own this weather database, right, or this weather API. I'm kind of stuck with how it comes out of the gate. And how it has is it, you know, when you get the the weather data out of here, it has it in two arrays where the index of the array matches. So it's like for 420 here, the temperature was 19Â° uh for for this. Um, and that's not going to really help us for our visualization. But Jason has this handy zip feature where then like if I'm going to put I'll put this in table view real quick. And then hide this bad boy. You can see then using zip, it will merge together those two. And I've got it in Fahrenheit here for this one, but um it'll merge together the date and the temperature. So anyway, and then for my electric demand, I've already got it by date already because that's just kind of how it comes. And with that you can get it then where here's your power demand uh that green line um and then you know the temperature that it was. So theoretically if this was real data it'd be like if the temperature got up uh the the power demand might go up or if the tow if the temperature drops power demand might drop for heating. Um but um and then another thing that this can show too is uh you've got to when you have to hide something or manipulate something or do use a transformation on only one of the data sources. So I need to do something again with that API data that I don't have control over. I can click this filter button on a transformation and only run a transformation against one of the queries which is super useful. Uh, and this also shows too there's, if you notice, I've got an axis on the right here and an axis on the left. If you go to this port portion here, um, and do an override, you can select a, uh, one of the fields here. So, I did temperature and then say it's going to be a right axis, uh, because by default there's always a left axis for time series. And then I can I can have two axises on the same uh, on the same time series. Um, that's kind of it. I have other stuff here, but I think we're running out of time, so we can cut that. I will um, you know, this is on goo on um, Graphana Play, so feel free to check this out. I will probably build this out a little bit better to do like not just a be, you know, what it is at the core, but like do a before and after of each of these visualizations to kind of show off like what I'm trying to demonstrate here a little better. Um, but yeah, just play around with it. The nice thing about uh Graphfana Play if you haven't played with it before is you can go in and edit anything. I can save it because I'm I uh this is my dashboard. But um anybody it's anonymous. You don't have to log in. You can hit edit and see all the transformations, see the data, everything. Um you just can't save it. So but that's what's really fun about Graphfana Play is you can see how people are building things and then map that to your own version of Graphana. That is so cool. Also, uh I did know about the matrix transformation. That's kind of like exactly the things that sort of Google Sheets or Excel also gives you when you want to chart. Um yeah, like BI data essentially. That's pretty cool. Yeah, I'll show you this too actually while we're talking about that. I know I said I was done with this, but I'm I'm never done with transformations. Uh there's this transpose. Uh I don't know if this is going to work well with this. Oh yeah, it does do something like imagine you that's like a basically a pivot if you need to pivot your ch your data. Um this is one of the ones where you definitely want to filter your data to the root or condense it as much as possible. Um but you can actually pivot your data to be like if this is something that like if it's coming out of the API and it's not working for your visualization honestly transpose can fix that a lot of the time. This is pretty cool. Yeah. Uh Christina, do you mind uh sharing the link uh of this uh uh dashboard uh so that uh I can paste it in the chat and uh our users can also play around with it. Yep. Yeah. Uh let's see here. This is the long one, but that's honestly good because yeah, if you don't have the time thing in here because this is going to go you need to have a week of information. So yeah, it's kind of a long link, but hopefully that's okay. Okay, I'm not sure if I or you pasted it here. Okay, I got it. So link address Awesome. Yeah, I think uh we are already No, we are not run out of time but um uh let me Yeah. Uh just a moment. What happened here? Okay. Yeah, the screen always changes. Yeah. So, thank you everyone. We run actually out of time again. There were some few questions which we could not answer. Uh but uh I think Christina and Galen already did an amazing job in showing us some cool demos and also uh uh telling us a lot more about like uh dashboard tips and big help from uh David and KL also sharing some deep insight and their experience in using some complex dashboards as well. So uh that's all for this uh month community call. Uh join us in the next one. Uh, time to say goodbye for and have a nice weekend. Thank you. Thank you all. Bye-bye. See you next time. Bye.
