Transcript: Hi everyone, Tom from Grafana Labs here! Looking 
forward to the ObservabilityCON conference in New   York, September the 24th and 25th. We're looking 
for about 400 people attending. Really looking   forward to coming back to New York this year, 
hanging out with our users, with the community,   with our friends, and hearing from some of our 
biggest customers. Our call for papers closes   on June 10th so if you're interested in speaking 
front of a large audience of experts, you know,   exchanging ideas with the community just hanging 
out with the Grafana Labs team, please do apply.   We're looking for talks you know on on a wide 
range of topics, but bonus points if you're using   large language models and generative AI to solve 
observability challenges. If you're, you know,   deploying OpenTelemetry at massive scale. You 
know, if you've got any War stories about bleeding   edge deployments of cutting edge technology 
such as Beyla or Faro or Asserts, please do   submit a proposal. Deadline is June the 10th 
and I look for to seeing you there. Thank you!
