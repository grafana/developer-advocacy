Transcript: modern Cloud native applications and browsers are incredibly complex making it challenging to truly understand how real users experience your website without clear visibility into the front-end experience you risk delivering a bad user experience and missing critical issues that could impact website performance but what if you could see exactly what your users are experiencing in real time this is where front end observability can be invaluable de clearing visibility for you front end observability also known as real user monitoring provides insights into how real users navigate and interact with your applications which can help you address issues that might not surface during the development process hi I'm Viola developer Advocate at grafana welcome to introduction to front-end observability with grafana Series in this video we'll explore grafana theoh a powerful front-end observability solution and walk through a Hands-On tutorial to help you easily get started with Pharaoh grana's front end obser ability comes in two key Parts Pharaoh which is open- Source software for retrieving and sending metrics and front end observability which is only available in graphon cloud and is graph's fully managed solution for real user monitoring in this video we'll focus exclusively on Pharaoh but make sure to check out the next video in this series to learn more about front and observability pharoh web SDK is an open- Source lightweight and highly configurable JavaScript agent that embeds directly into your web application FAL allows you to connect observability data from your web application and send it to graphon cloud data like performance metrics logs exceptions errors events and traces with this data you gain endtoend visibility into how real users interact with your application which helps you catch issues before they impact the user experience then users have two options open source users can use signals via the data collected by phoh which is sent to graphon alloy and can be integrated seamlessly with graff's lgtm stack this provides a seamless full stack observability solution that is completely open source or users can use our fully managed solution graphon Cloud front and observability solution the data collected by phoh is sent to a hosted endpoint in graphon cloud and then users get automatic out of the box dashboard theoh supports all web applications running in the browser now that you understand what Faro is and how it can help you let's walk through a tutorial for how to instrumentalize our JavaScript application with phoh we will be using quick pizza this is a demo web application that allows users to generate new and exciting Pizza combination you can get access to this application through the link in the description box there are a few ways to instrument phoh but this is the best way to do it if you are a graphon cloud user we'll start by creating an application in graphon Cloud sign into your graphon Cloud instance on the homepage visit the left navigation panel and click front end now we are on the graphon cloud front to end observability page we will click create new next we see a form that allows us to start configuring our application to be set up we will fill out the name for this video we will choose quick Pizza app next we will choose our domain name quick pizza is running locally on Local Host 3333 so that is what we will add to this section click next we will connect our web application you have the option to choose your package type to install phoh I'll choose npm but you also have the option to add the graffo fow web SDK package using a CDN if your project doesn't have a package manager I'll move to my terminal to install the necessary phoh packages next we will choose sampling rate this allows us to set the percentage of sessions that should be sampled we will stick to the defaults you have the option to choose between normal or persistent session the difference between normal and persistent session is that normal sessions and when the user closes the tab and persistent sessions continue after the user closes the tab or browser Now we move to your code base there is a simple code snippet you can add to apply Auto instrumenting for security purposes it is recommended to not hardcode your url but we will do so for demo purposes we choose continue to move to the next step the third section is upload Source map this is entirely optional but it will enable you to see the original source code of the error in the front end observability application now we will choose completes as you can see when we reload quick pizza our grafana dashboard page load metric increases which indicates that the Ferro connection is working correctly not only do you have page load but we also get important web vital metrics like ttfb time to First Bite FCP first contentful paint and other metrics there you have it you now know about pharaoh and how to instrument
