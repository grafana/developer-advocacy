Transcript: hi I'm Kyle Cottingham a software engineer on graan datais Squad in graan 11 we've added an often requested feature to the table panel and that's the ability to conditionally format table rows let's go ahead and set that up now I have a dashboard here already uh with a table panel already too um and I want to color this table uh using this level field so what I'm going to do is start editing this uh first thing I'm going to do to do this is set up some value mappings this will allow us to get the colors so I go down in the right column and click add value mappings under value mappings so first I'll do info and for info let's do green and then add another one we're just going to do by exact values uh the next one will be worn let's set that to Yellow uh just to make sure that we're getting it and then finally let's to error uh that should make it easier to find any errors in these logs unless set that one to Red click update and so far we're not seeing the colors yet uh we just have the value mappings so in order to see the colors for these we're going to go to overrides I'm going to add a field override I'll select the name in this case uh we're doing the level field let's add an override property now and then I want to go down to cell type type this will allow me to select the colored background cell type which will apply the color okay and actually apply to entire row is already selected in this case um so we're good to go um we see we have info and warning showing with the different colors let's see if we can see any errors oh there are some wow that was way easier than just uh browsing through if there's no colors applied that's looking pretty good um but you may be asking uh what if we have numeric values instead rather than just a set of labels like this so let's apply this and I have another table set up so let's go over to that now uh with this table we just have CPU usage information over time so I'm going to go in and edit this and again go down the right side uh this time to thresholds instead so first I'm really curious about when things are not going so well so let's add 90 in here okay and set that to Red um we probably don't want High CPU usage all the time and I'll add another one in here for a warning how about 75 okay cool and just like last time we're not seeing the colors right away uh so what I'm going to do is go to field overrides add a field override and select the name in this case again so the a series is the one I want to color that's where the Val value that I'm interested in is uh then I add an override property same thing I select the cell type and then go to the colored background cell um in this case the option wasn't applied already uh so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and apply that option it does look like we already have the color for the a series so let's check this out all right excellent um so we're getting the color for the whole row let's see if we're getting into any bad conditions down here oh wow it looks like we had some time where things weren't going so well um but other times where things were going well otherwise though it's way easier to see what's going on and I can see when these conditions are happening which is really useful to what I'm doing um I'm not super great with this background so instead I'm just going to do basic instead so that way there's no gradient all right cool apply that and it looks like everything is good to go um so that is the new uh row formatting uh to the table panel that we've added to graphon 11 we're very excited for everyone to get the chance to use this um and we're continuing to expand this functionality with different types of formatting um as we go along thank you so much and we hope you enjoy graffan 11
