# Optimize Observability and Cut Costs Without Losing Insights | What is Adaptive Telemetry? | Grafana

Managing telemetry can quickly spiral out of control, leading to ballooning costs and overwhelming data volumes. But what if you ...

Transcript: hi I'm Tom the CTO at graan Labs today I want to talk a bit about one of the exciting new features in graan Cloud adaptive Telemetry I want to talk about how it works how it helps teams achieve better observability without cost spikes when it comes to Telemetry many engineering teams operate with a collect everything mindset to ensure nothing valuable or useful is missed this often leads to uncontrollable growth in data volumes and escalating costs that are unaligned with the value you get from your observability recognizing this challenge we developed adaptive Telemetry this is a range of features in grafana Cloud that optimizes which signals we store only keeping the most valuable Telemetry and giving you control over your observability costs the Breakthrough in adaptive Telemetry is that we classify signals based on their use whether it's involved in queries alerts or displayed on a dashboard based on this classification data is aggregated dropped sampled or otherwise reduced if it's deemed low value this ensured that the ingested data is both cost effective and valuable optimizing your observability whilst keeping these costs manageable this approach is fully automated adaptive Telemetry regularly analyzes your usage patterns and updates Its Behavior this feedback loop continuously learns what Telemetry is most valuable allowing us to automatically respond to changing patterns of usage the system is also flexible you can manually instruct it to always retain or drop certain dimensions for different teams you can always put an operator in the loop to review these recommendations our approach work equally well for organizations that want something that just works out the box or for teams that require a bit more risk averse method one of our customers teletracking saw this firsthand by implementing adaptive Telemetry they managed to cut their spending by 46% without losing coverage or important insights this approach allowed their teams to expand observability coverage whilst controlling costs making an ideal solution for their Cloud environment where high cardinality was a concern that was blown away that we were pushing over 1.5 million Time series I knew we weren't using half that and here's the point I knew and we all knew that we weren't using this many metrics but we paid for them and we needed to find out where they came from adaptive metrics does a lot for us but we don't work much to make adaptive metrics work adaptive metrics saved us 50% on our bill and saved us lots of time since we stopped scrambling to make client side changes to Tamp down metrics we just let graffic Cloud do that adaptive Telemetry helps you manage high cardinality and dynamic environments especially in Cloud settings where you could for example be autoscaling in response to demand by adapting to changes in real time ensures your observability remains cost effective even during unexpected spikes the result you get reliable insights without compromising your budget adaptive Telemetry stops the uncontrolled growth of your observability costs and finally offers a solution that aligns these costs with value it's natural to be concerned about losing signals when implementing adaptive Telemetry especially for instance in instant response scenarios that's why we've added features like exemptions which allow you to preserve signals you may consider critical exemptions give you the control to decide which data remains intact ensuring that nothing essential is lost even as you optimize costs with exemptions you can fine-tune your setup to retain the data you value most while still benefiting from adaptive telemetry's cost savings providing the right balance and ensuring you don't sacrifice observability for cost optimization so soon adaptive Telemetry will extend beyond metrics and logs to include traces and profiles ensuring every piece of telemetry you rain is truly valuable give it a try and graina a cloud and let us know what you think [Music]
