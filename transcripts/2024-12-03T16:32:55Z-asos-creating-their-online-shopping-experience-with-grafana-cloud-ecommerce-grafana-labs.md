Transcript: ASOS is an online
fashion retailer. Our goal is to be the number one fashion
destination for fashion loving 20-somethings.  10 years ago at ASOS, observability didn't
really exist as a concept. Data was spread out. It was difficult to find what you
needed. When there was an incident, you had to go and find all of
the information you wanted. We didn't have a centralized data
store. So over the last 10 years, we've worked very hard at
getting data into a single, centralized data store where we
can explore that information, Not only reactively when
there's an incident, but proactively - going in and
understanding our system behavior. Adoption of Grafana at ASOS
has been an organic process. The data source approach that Grafana
offers means we can plug in any data source we want into this and it allows
us to view any telemetry that we want from any system that we are
capturing that data points on. We have quite a few tools actually, in
SRE, that we try and get people to use in the platforms, but I have never seen
people have a problem with Grafana. I think it just slips
into the same kind of queries that they were doing in Azure
already to understand the services that they were developing.
And as they go live, they will typically put
those queries on a dashboard. So I have to say one of the
nice things about Grafana is, it's just never been a blocker from a
knowledge point of view, which is good. It gives us this holistic view to
understand our systems from a user perspective, very much
from the customer's eyes, giving us those journeys that we
know when a customer's impacted, when there's a problem that's really impacting
our customers trying to browse and shop the site. Having all the monitoring
in one place helps. We shift between views in different
systems. We can go deeper on, on the same platform. We
have high level dashboards. If we see something fluctuating
there we can, all in Grafana, zoom in look into details and that helps to
identify it quicker and then resolve it quicker as well. Before Grafana, having a consolidated view
across all of our data sources simply wasn't possible. But the data source model that Grafana
gives us, means that we can quickly plot any data from any source that we want,
alongside existing telemetry data that we might already have. And this
gives us such a clear view.  So after Grafana: consolidation, aggregation of data
onto a single pane and that's the real power of this. We are more prepared and more confident. We
understand not only what metrics matter most to us, but we understand how they sit in the holistic picture
of of the systems and the services that we support. When something shows red on
our SLOs or our error budgets, we know that that's a real problem and
not just something that might go away later. So we are much more confident
that the metrics that we are using accurately represent and describe
the systems that ASOS relies on.
