Transcript: Are you looking to get started 
with performance testing,   but you don't know where to start? Well 
this is good news for you. Grafana k6 is   an open-source developer-friendly tool that can 
help you get started with performance testing   as easy as possible. Not convinced? Let me 
show you how. So after you've installed k6,   k6 now comes with a new subcommand to generate a 
new test script. This is useful for users who want   to get started quickly or for experienced users 
who want to save time when creating test scripts.  To use this command, I'm going to type k6 new 
followed by the file name and as you can see   there's now a new k6 test script in demo.js.
So if we quickly open this file, you can see   a boilerplate of code that can help you 
get started with k6. To run this test,   just use k6 run and then the file name and voila, 
you've just run your first test script using k6.
