Transcript: Alloy is a tool for collecting, enriching, and sending telemetry data. It
is compatible with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Pyroscope, and
Loki backends and protocols. It is Grafana's distribution
of the OpenTelemetry collector. Included is built-in support for
the most common source of signals, including Kubernetes,
Linux, Windows, Postgres, cloud providers, and
dozens of other sources. Alloy scales from a single node
collection to a highly available auto-scaling cluster, collecting
telemetry data from thousands of sources. It is the only tool you need for moving
and enriching telemetry data from wherever it lives to
your backend database.
