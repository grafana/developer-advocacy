Transcript: Hi, I am Serge, a senior software engineer on the
dashboards team here in Grafana Labs. Today I want to talk
about the new filters UI, a feature that is available
in a public preview. The main goal here was to have a better
UI that makes interactions with ad-hoc filters much faster and more intuitive. And we achieved that by creating a combo
box-like input where you can manage all your filters at once. So let me demonstrate the changes and
we'll be comparing the old and the new UI by creating, editing and deleting
free filters. In the old UI, you would have to create a separate
filter in a separate box in the new ui. The filters are combined into a single
box and you can use your mouse or you can use keyboard to create the sync filters. The first thing you might notice is that
the new UI requires less clicks and it also takes up less space, which makes
dashboard variables less crowded. In order to edit the filter,
you can either click on it, you can select it, navigating with shift
tab and tap keys and pressing enter. And in order to edit the operator, you can do the same while
navigating and selecting it. In order to delete a filter, you
can click on the delete icon. You can do the same using the keyboard
or you can press backspace in order to delete the filter. In the older UI, you would only be able to delete
filters using the remove icon. As you might have noticed already, we made quite an effort to make sure
that the new UI is much more keyboard friendly and faster to use. And lastly, I want to mention the new multi-value
support in the ad-hoc filters. If your data source supports multi values, then you will be able to use
one-off or not one-off operator. And this will allow you to select
multiple values for your filter. And that's pretty much it for the demo. I hope it was useful and you will
enjoy using the new filter UI.
