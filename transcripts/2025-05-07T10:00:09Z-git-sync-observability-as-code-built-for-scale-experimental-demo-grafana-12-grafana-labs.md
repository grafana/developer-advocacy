Transcript: Hi, I am Fabrizia Rossano, staff PM at Grafana Labs and I'm here
to talk about the Git sync feature. This feature will be available as
experimental on OSS and Enterprise from Grafana 12 and rolled out to
our cloud customers over the following quarters. With this feature, we aim to answer the basic
question. Who changed my dashboards? Jokes aside, the Git sync
does much more than that. It enables the full dashboard as code
experience with minimal configuration, keeping your dashboards and some
other resources in sync with your Git repository alongside
the rest of your code, and integrates the ability to review the
changes before they're visible to the whole organization. You'll
find more info in the docs. And now let's get started with
the setup. As you can see, I have no dashboard in this instance, so I go into the
provisioning menu and I start configuring the Git sync.
I can paste my access token, select the repository, change some of the settings,
and start synchronizations. This point I see I have one file is
in external storage, and as I said, my instance is empty. I can sync all resources with external storage. That means that my whole instance will be synced to Git and every dashboard
that I add will be automatically part of the sync. Or I can sync the content of
the repository to a specific folder, which means that only things
in that folder will be then saved to Git. I'll choose the first one. I'll click synchronize. I have some information on the process, and then I click on begin synchronization, which starts the process.
It can take, as I said, a few seconds to a few minutes depending
on how many dashboards you have. In this case, this was super quick and I'll go on in the process and choose
additional settings. I'm not going to change anything in this
page. When I click finish, I have the connection set up, sync up to date, and I
see I have one dashboard. So if I go back to my dashboards, I can see that now I
have a test dashboard. If I open it, I have two panels, one panels as for descriptions. I'm going to go and edit
it and call it bar chart. This point, I go back to the
dashboards, I see the changes, and I save the dashboards. I can push to a new branch.
That's what I'm going to do. When I save it, I get another information banner that
tells me that only I can see this change, the new title for the chart and I can
then open up a pull request in GitHub. To show you this, I'm going to open a new window, open Grafana, and if I go to dashboard
and test, you see, I still see the old one, close this and open Git. At this point, I can create a new pull request and what you can see here is that based
on the configuration that I have, there is an autogenerated
comment on this pull request as links to the original
dashboards and the preview of the dashboards. This point I'm
just going to confirm merge and if I go back to my Grafana dashboards, so I'll go back
to this one and open the test, changes are hear and that's the
functionality in a nutshell. So thanks everybody for
following and please, please try it and give us feedback.
