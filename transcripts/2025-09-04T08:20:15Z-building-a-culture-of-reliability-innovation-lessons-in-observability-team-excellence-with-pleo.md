# Observability Journey Discussion with Camille

**Dave Russell:**  
Uh well, my name is Dave Russell. I'm the director of Voice of Customer here at Grafana Labs. Let's sit down and have a chat with Camille. Let's do it up. 

**Camille:**  
Yeah, perfect. Let's start with the basics. So, my name is Camille. I'm the VP of Engineering at Playo. I cover all the platform sides of our site, including backend infrastructure, front end infrastructure, and payments infrastructure. Basically, everything that ends with "infrastructure," that's me.

**Dave:**  
That's awesome. For those who aren't familiar with Playo, what does Playo do? 

**Camille:**  
Playo is a product that makes it really easy for companies to handle expenses. It has also been something that's been driven by the employees, actually, by many of our customers.

---

**Dave:**  
Okay. So, obviously, we're here to talk about observability. I can imagine you've been on this journey for a little while now. How has that observability journey and strategy changed and evolved over time?

**Camille:**  
If you go back about three years, Playo was very much in a startup state, and we rapidly transitioned into a scale-up state. What happened then was that we just picked something off the shelf. No one really thought about it, and it was sitting there costing a lot of money. Last year, I concluded that we needed to take a much more proactive stance on observability. That’s how we ended up with Grafana today.

---

**Dave:**  
When you were selecting that platform, what considerations were important to you? 

**Camille:**  
As a developer and engineer at heart, I've always focused on how I can automate away pain points. When we doubled down on platform engineering at Playo, we asked ourselves how we could offload tasks from the makers in the organization. We wanted engineers to focus on customers rather than having to deal with Kubernetes, setting up new services, repositories, and so on. 

We had a big legacy of monitors—thousands of unknown monitors and dashboards. It was crucial for me that we could programmatically describe and establish lineage on who owns each dashboard, monitor, and alert so that everything was codified. The second important element was establishing a partnership with the vendor we chose. Having a strong partnership allows me to influence the product and bring in people from the vendor to help us improve observability.

---

**Dave:**  
So, the first point was about developer efficiency, and the second was around business value and the partnership with the vendor. What does your team look like? How is it structured?

**Camille:**  
We have about 180 engineers at Playo, and our engineering organization is divided into two or three different areas. We have a sizable platform domain that contains what we call a group, which consists of many teams. We have a backend and infrastructure group, which includes teams focused on dev experience, backend core, authentication, and security. This structure helps us codify observability from a central point, aiding other makers across the business to continue improving the overall experience.

---

**Dave:**  
What lessons have you learned about structuring the team for balancing efficiency and collaboration?

**Camille:**  
When you're in a startup state, people become emotionally attached to their work, and this can lead to varying styles and approaches, especially in a geographically dispersed organization. As we formed the platform domain, we had to manage functional and non-functional requirements while also addressing emotional attachments to certain ways of working. You need to ensure that people still feel ownership over their work, even when you limit choices. It’s about being respectful and thoughtful in how you implement these changes.

---

**Dave:**  
Absolutely. Change management is crucial, especially when it impacts daily work. How do you think about balancing reliability and innovation?

**Camille:**  
People often see innovation and reliability as opposing forces, but I don't think they have to be. When we hold hackathons, people come up with innovative ideas to solve problems that have been overlooked. The faster you can go from idea to implementation without being bogged down by boilerplate tasks, the more room there is for innovation. I would love for our product managers to create services with minimal barriers so they can focus on logic and ideas.

---

**Dave:**  
That’s a great approach. When developers are passionate about a project, they can accomplish amazing things quickly. Can you share an example of innovation from your team?

**Camille:**  
Last year, we started an associate program for engineers at Playo. We have 11 associates now, some of whom were previously nurses or fresh out of school. They join our teams as engineers. One associate switched from the customer support team to engineering. During his first hackathon, he leveraged his user perspective to fix a back-office tool. The barrier was low, and they got it done quickly.

---

**Dave:**  
That's fantastic! How often do hackathons occur in your organization?

**Camille:**  
It seems like about 20-30% of our audience participates in regular hackathons. They often lead to impactful innovations rather than just fun projects. For instance, engineers have made significant improvements in query speeds and memory footprints during these events.

---

**Dave:**  
That’s impressive. How do you foster collaboration between different teams, like SRE teams and developers?

**Camille:**  
We spent a lot of time last year consolidating expertise. Rather than having experts scattered across the organization, our SRE team is centralizing Terraform so that we have a central repository. This way, developers can easily create resources without needing extensive knowledge. It opens the floor for meaningful discussions between SRE, dev experience, and other teams.

---

**Dave:**  
Where do you stand on centralized versus distributed observability practices?

**Camille:**  
I'm a strong proponent of a centralized setup. If we can create a single ultimate dashboard to track service styles, it simplifies things for everyone. However, it’s important to recognize that smaller teams may not have the same capacity for centralization. Having champions in different teams helps bridge the gap and promotes local insights.

---

**Dave:**  
Absolutely. Those champions can bring innovations and feedback from various teams. How do you ensure people embrace the "you build it, you own it" mentality without it feeling burdensome?

**Camille:**  
It’s about empowering people. They should feel safe knowing they have the tools they need to deploy services and monitor them effectively. If they are equipped with features like canary releases or automatic rollbacks, it eases the anxiety of ownership. When they understand they're supported, they are more willing to take on responsibilities.

---

**Dave:**  
It’s crucial to make sure people know they are supported. Lastly, what does onboarding look like for someone new to the observability team?

**Camille:**  
For our associate program, we have a 12-week onboarding process where they are exposed to various aspects of the business. We intentionally bring in leaders from different departments to provide a broader perspective. We also have hands-on coding tutorials to help them learn how to create services. When we selected our observability vendor, I emphasized the need for a solution that works for everyone, from principal engineers to those new to engineering.

---

**Dave:**  
That sounds like a well-structured onboarding process. Thank you for sharing your insights, Camille!

## Raw YouTube Transcript

Uh well, my name is Dave Russell. I'm director of voice of customer here at Grafana Labs. Let's sit down and have a chat with Camille. Let's do it up. All right. So, we're going to be talking sort of about the observability journey uh that you've been on. But before we do that, perhaps a quick intro. Who are you? What do you do? Those kind of things. Yeah, perfect. Let's start with the basics. So, my name is Camille. Uh I'm the VP of engineering at PLO. Uh so I cover off all the uh platform sites of our site. So basically uh backend infrastructure, front end infrastructure, payments infrastructure. Yeah, everything that ends with infrastructure. Me. Yeah, that's awesome. And for those that aren't familiar with Player, what what do Playo do? So Playo is a product that makes it really easy for companies to do uh expenses. So it's uh has also been something that's been driven by the employees actually uh by many our our customers. Yeah. Very good. Very good. Okay. So obviously we're here to talk about observability. Um and you know I can imagine you've been on this journey for a little while now. How has that observability journey how's that strategy kind of changed and evolved over time? So I think um if you go back like three years in time uh PLO was very much like in a startup state and then we very very rapidly went into a scaleup state. So uh what happened then is like we had u just picked something off the shelf. No one really thought about it. It was sitting there costing a lot of money and like uh last year I I came to a conclusion that we need to make something much more uh we need to make a take a stance at obserability. Um so I think that is uh how we ended up with Grafana today. Uh awesome. And so when you were selecting that platform um you know what what things came into that consideration? What were the things that you were you were really looking that for? What was important to you when you're making that that that choice? So I I'm a developer at heart uh and an engineering at heart. So I I've been at it for a very very long time and uh so I always look at like how can I automate away pains. So one of the things that we did with like when we doubled down on platform engineering at PO is that we said how can we offload things from uh the all the makers out in the organization. How can we make engineers really focus on the customers rather than having to think about Kubernetes setting up new services, repositories, whatever. And like observability is the same thing. So we had a big legacy of many many many monitors like thousands of unknown monitors, dashboards, whatever. So what was important for me in the observability selection was um that we could programmatically describe and have sort of lineage on who owns each dashboard, each monitor, each alert so that we have it codified. So that was one of the things that that that was really driving for me. And I think the second element that was a big driver for me is like how can I get a partnership with the with the vendor that I choose. So we bet quite a lot of them and then like I think that having a strong uh partnerships allows me to influence the product u solarized. Yeah, talked about that with Mitch earlier today. Uh and um like I can also then bring thing people back into my organization and say how can how can we get better at observability talking about SLOs's uh or whatever that might be. So that was like uh the the two kind of criterias that was really important for me. So it's almost sort of the the first one was almost about like developer efficiency. Yeah. And the second one was more around the the business value, business impact, that side of things. The partnership between the vendor and us. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. So what does what does your team look like? How are they structured? How's that built out? So uh like I said like um I think we have two or three different sides of our engineering organization at PLO which like 180 engineer somewhat um and uh we have a sizable platform domain uh that contains what we call a group and a group is many teams and we have a backend and infrastructure uh group called uh where we have sur we have devx we have backend core authentication team security so I think That's that's where all this happens. And then we have a sibling a group called the front end infrastructure that kind of also deals with uh sort of the front end side of things. Uh but that is how we have structured ourselves to really be able to kind of have a a nucleus of uh platform offering uh codifying obsibility from a very central part. uh and that that helps all the other makers out in the other domains, other sides of the business to yet again yeah continue working on the business experience. Nice. Okay. So what lessons have you learned about structuring sort of the team or the organization for uh like balancing things like efficiency and collaboration? H yeah I think what I've learned is that when you are in a startup state people really really get emotionally attached to the things they do. So and then they tend to do that in their own style in their own tribe in their place and then especially when you are a very geographically dispersed uh organization you tend to get a lot of very different things. So as we were putting together this uh platform domain, there was a lot of sort of was logical steps like the functional requirements and then the nonfunctional requirements was like how do you handle emotions like attachment to certain ways of doing things? How do you make people especially engineers feel that they can still own what they do when you take away some of the choices. So you have to be quite sure uh sureooted on the choices you do because it's going to impact someone else's eight hours a day when they work every day. Um so so it's about limiting choice but doing that such in in a intelligent and respectful way I would say. So that's that's a lesson. Yeah. I mean any any kind of change management process like that any changes you're going through that are going to impact people's kind of daily working lives uh you know you want to make sure they they feel bought into the changes they understand why the changes are made. Exactly. And I think it's like sometimes it's just about making people feel heard um so that they can voice their opinion and you can say I listen to you. I took that into account. Um, and then then you can sometimes integrate that. But of course, you cannot have a solution that's perfect for everyone because then you just get the mediocre middle ground. Yeah. Yeah. I I see that a lot in in my dayto-day. Like customers don't really get as upset when we tell them, "I'm sorry, we're we're not going to build that special snowflake feature that only you in the world really wants." Sometimes they go, "It's a shame. I'd really like that." that and we go, well, it's not going to happen this time. Customers get upset when they feel that you haven't listened to them or that you don't understand why they need this thing or why it's so important to them and especially if you if you aren't able to explain some of the wider context around why you're making those kind of decisions. So, yeah, that really really resonates with me as well. Um so when you're thinking about this this culture of of collaboration um again sort of one of these balancing things how do you think about um sort of balancing reliability and innovation um and sort of encouraging that experimentation while still um wanting to maintain the the velocity and sorry the stability of the platform like some of the things that Billy was talking about during his session. Yeah. No, I think it's like a it's a very interesting question. Um, so I think sometimes people thinks that innovation and reliability is like at odds with one another, but I I really don't think it that's that's to be the case because like when you innovate, you can look at like we we often have like this kind of hackathons uh within FL and people always come up with some super super cool ideas and then you have to think about like what is limiting them when they do hackathon stuff. It's very rarely about okay I'm gonna try a new technology and it's more like I spotted this problem that actually no one has done anything about and I think I can use something super cool to do that. Um and um I I also kind of come to the realization like the faster you can go from idea to have something working when you can remove like the boilerplate stuff that is when you can then go innovate you can go and try this new thing it's it's almost to the point where I would love like if our PMs could go and like create services and like just kind of explain the logic inside of it because the rest is taken care of. Um so I think that is also how you get um uh innovative culture when you don't have to kind of get stuck on like steps um before. Yeah. When when uh when developers are working on something that they're really passionate about and really excited about and like especially if it's a it's an itch they've been wanting to scratch for some time, it's amazing just to kind of see what they can get done in such a short period of time. It it is for sure, right? And I think like uh one very cool example is um last year we started with the associate program for engineers at PLO. Uh so we we have like 11 of them today and these are people that they one used to be a nurse. Uh a few of them are fresh out of school. They they join our teams as proper engineers. And there was this uh one person who switched competency from the customer support team to the engineering team. and his first hackathon he was like I have so much experience with the back office tool from a user perspective and I really I need to fix this thing so he sat down with some of the other engineers and since it's the barrier was so low they fixed it it's amazing it's fantastic so I'm actually I'm curious now this totally unplanned but I'm just desperate desperate to know show of hands like how many of you are in organizations where things like hackathons happen on a on a regular basis It's probably about maybe 20 30% something like that. Um they they really are like amazing experiences. And one of the things that fascinates me with hackathons is you might expect that engineers will just spend their time on like frivolous like fun things, but they really don't tend to. like you'll get the odd kind of kooky thing that will through up that'll make everyone laugh and feel good about it. But you know engineers coming with oh like we've managed to increase the query speed of this by 10x under these conditions that we're seeing or reduce the memory footprint of this this tool by by by by 50% just by optimizing things like yeah these are things that have been bugging them for ages. they just never got the time to to step back look at these kind of challenges and and like those those are really genuinely impactful things to the business that get done. I mean 100% right and I think like I I keep talking about this platform engineering piece but I think like with with the obsoility tool where where where you can codify uh good defaults from start it's also yet again where you create the service you have this idea and you have your dashboard you have your alerts everything is there for you from stat start you don't have to think about it it's already ingesting from the from the moment you click create service so yeah I think that is how Grafano is uh enabling um good uh monitoring at our side. Awesome. Okay. So, thinking about the the relationships between some of the different teams, so things like uh S sur teams and developers, how how do you kind of foster collaboration between different teams in the organization? Yeah, that's also something we spent a lot of time on uh in in the last year, I must say. Like I think um yet again like consolidating uh things from where uh maker teams used to need like hire someone with Kubernetes knowledge, monitoring knowledge uh to have these experts out in the organization rather than having much more healthy mix. I think uh the way we have uh made that work is uh our S sur team is like slowly codifying and kind of centralizing uh terraform uh so that we have a central repository of that and then they are creating modules packaged our way. So as a as a developer then uh within playo you don't have to think about like okay how do I create an RDS rather than here's the oneliner for that and then then I have that set up according to all the best practices automatically connected to SLOs's whatnot uh and I think then then the discussion becomes much more interesting with this because then you can start between the S sur team and developer experience team and the rest of the uh dev teams at play to talk about okay But I need a different style of database or I need a different style of this um and uh that's where we have seen a a good surface and we have also seen that upskilling our S sur members to be become really really really good at uh observability for example has also made it so that we can create this community of practice around observability where they kind of today they are mostly the injectors of information as it's uh with this tool is still quite you but um we're also kind of hoping that uh we'll get like these champions across the organization that can then also contribute to it. So it doesn't always have to be S and the developers, but it can be more of like a community effort. Yeah. Because I was I was going to ask you where where do you stand on the sort of the the centralized versus the sort of the distributed when it comes to observability practice? I'm I'm very much for the centralized uh setup and uh one of the reasons I believe in that is that if we can create uh sort of the single ultimate dashboard to track uh service style that we have um then we have already done that work for you. All you have to do is go to drop down select your service and then that's the sort of spoonfed best setup that you can get. Um, so it's of course hard for everyone to do. Like I've been in senior positions in both very small companies and quite large companies. It's like in a large company you can afford to have a centralized setup while in a in a smaller team you might not have that. Uh so it's it's always worth kind of having that in the back of your mind. Yeah. And and even when you have that centralized team, having those champions out in those and those other teams that will be advocating for you, yeah, you know, when when you you're not there will bring you the feedback from those groups, will kind of Yeah. They'll be they'll be the the sort of the almost the face of observability within those teams is really important as well. I mean for sure you you kind of break the uh us versus them barrier by by having them because then maybe they can be very local to like an office or like we have very many offices across Europe. So having someone who kind of looks at the engineers in the in in specific office then you can hear this uh chat next to the coffee machines or whatever like it's you can pick up things in a different way. Um, also you have a much more distributed setup, so you're not as sensitive for people going on vacations or or or whatever it might be. Yeah. Yeah. And also the nice thing about that is sometimes uh those folks in those different parts of the organization bring innovations to you like they they experiment, they play with things, they're like, "Oh, look what we've been able to build within our team." And that can be another stream of innovation coming in back towards the central group. I mean, for sure. Right. For sure. And like I I personally has observed this in the our internal uh community of practice for observability like where where where someone said actually found found a way to uh uh visualize this specific metric in a in this kind of way and then people are kind of uh picking up on that and then like I think we do this um internal developer survey uh once or twice per year where we kind of pick up like okay what's going on? what's what are your needs? Uh so I'm I'm hoping to get the observability more on that uh agenda as well. Fantastic. All right. So when it comes to things like um people say use the phrase you build it, you own it. uh sometimes. Um how h how can you like how can you make sure that uh people embrace that without sort of feeling like it's a it's an ownorous kind of requirement on them? It's it's a tough one for sure. It's about empowering people. So like they should feel safe that they have all the mechanics they need to be able to deploy something see how it works and then if you have given them the right tools it's like uh if that's canary releases or uh automatic roll backs or uh blue green deploys or or or whatever that might be it makes it so much easier for people to kind of say okay I can be on call for this because I know that I have built a lot of mechanics in there but If if if it's people going uh blind, then then then it's less comfortable to say, "Okay, I'm going to own it and I might get called in on a Saturday afternoon." Yeah. So, it's it's um having a lot of automatic things in the in the background really helps. Yeah. Yeah. And basically I've always found that some of this is about just making sure that the the people know that they're they're supported like that the you know they're not just out there hanging in the breeze all on their own. No for sure. Right. And I think like we we we spent a lot of time in the last two years to get really good at uh working with incidents. We have implemented a specific incident tool. We have um something we call historical thing with PLO is that um there's a lot of space references. Uh so services typically was was called moons. Uh our own call team is called astronauts. Um so so so we have a big band of astronauts clear if you didn't know. Um and uh they are the ones that kind of like distribute across the organization that are kind of on call for all of it. Um, so really making sure that they have all the tools they need to to to really see what's going on in production helps. Yeah. Yeah. It does always amuse me by the way when when people talk about some of their internal niches and like some people use aerospace, some people use confectionary, um, some people, you know, use uh use space and that side of things, but uh, yeah, it's always always fun. Um, so you mentioned the the associate program. Um, so as a as a bit of a follow on to that, what what does on boarding look like for for someone new into the observability team? Like how do you how do you ramp someone up in in that space? When you say the observability team, you mean to like uh if I hire someone into the SR Yeah. Yeah. Like I think um it probably looks a bit different. Uh so far we have hired uh quite early career people also into the S team. They have worked out quite well. I think they have a very good system of distributing tasks. Uh but if you look at the the the general associate program for engineers that we have is uh they they are on a 12week program when they join. So every week they get to see something new from the business. So I have very intentfully like made sure like okay how can we get the CPO into the room? Can we get the designer to talk to them about what what their view is like? Maybe someone from sales. So it's like I I really want to make sure that the engineers that join they get like um a wider uh perspective of what it means to work in a company. Uh and then we also have like very much hands on uh coding tutorials with them like how you create services and whatever. And like when when we did the vendor selection for obserability last autumn, that was one of the things that really uh that I kept asking about and kept pointing out that whatever we choose needs to work for anything from our uh principal uh engineers all the way down to the associate engineers because if you come from a background of being a nurse for example, like even with the best of intentions, dashboards can be super hard. uh understanding logs can be super hard but maybe you're like okay I know the core mechanics but you have to help me here uh so that was super important uh part so that we could like really trim trim away things we don't really need and then package that really nice setup for all engineers. Um so yeah that's uh that's how we set it up for success for the associates. Fantastic. Fantastic. for rights.
