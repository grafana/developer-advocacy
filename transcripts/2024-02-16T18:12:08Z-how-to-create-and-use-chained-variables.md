Transcript: thank you very much for your questions Rudolph here's a quick example of how you can create a chain Parable first we will depart from the tickers variable that we created in the video above we already have it so we're going to create a second variable that will be changed to it will pull information from it so why don't we generate a select statement this is just an example to show you how it is updated so let's put the ticker value after this statement the select statement so that it gets updated let's save it it and now we are going to go out and change the first variable since the second one is changed to it you'll be able to see it updating even if it's a query or any other function stay tuned for examples on the ad hoc variables coming soon
