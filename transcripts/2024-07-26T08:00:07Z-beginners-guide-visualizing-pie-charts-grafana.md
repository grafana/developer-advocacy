Transcript: [Music] hello graph Antics overwhelmed by data and wishing you could arrange and slice through it as if it was a pie well today we will go over the delicious pie chart which allows you to consolidate a bunch of data in a proportionately sliced up pie so you can easily identify by size how many calories each size will [Music] bring pie charts display series or values in a series from one or more queries that they relate to each other in the form of slices of a pie the slices are all proportional to their value relative to the sum of all values this type of chart is best used when you want a quick comparison of a small set of values in a yummy and easy to digest form we will use grafana plate to create our first pie chart panel the step we will work as well in a local grafana setup to to access graan Play Link in the corner graan play's home screen is a dashboard here you can follow these steps to add a panel in the panel editor set the panel as pie chart at the top right corner to quickly get a visualization we will use a test data data source and select the CSV file and population by state super easy we got our first pie we can hover over to identify what each slice is now to understand better how how the data is displayed we can turn to the table view as you can see here the data is grouped by years not So Much by States as you may have expected this is because by default the pie chart likes to group data by columns the pie chart is very flexible with the data requirements allowing you to even display multiple queries at once but it will always display a single pi and as mentioned by columns for this demonstration I have prepared some sets of data that we will use use today you can find them as CSV Below in the video description okay we will pull first the multiple data set and change our tast data data source to CSV content and paste it there fast and easy you have the values displayed proportionately in the pie hovering over you can tell it's just displaying the last row of our data so why don't we make it easier and paste now the just one data set here much better right it displays exactly what is in the data as we have only one row now if you are wondering how to work with multiple rows like we had earlier or how to display every row or their titles that and many other cool things are achieved through customizations so why don't we go over possible customizations of a pie chart [Music] panel the first thing that you can customize in the pie chart is the general panel options it contains title description transparencies and so on this is common to almost all panels in grafana for more info check the link in the corner but for now we will just change the title as yummy pie chart next we have the value options in this the first thing that you can change is the way the data is shown this is calculated or display all the values in case that you select all the values this will add every value returned by your queries every will be added to the P regardless of row or column since you could have too many you can limit how many you want to be and the maximum added to the pie and under it the values you want to be picked up either all of them or just the numeric ones or picking all from just one column but if you select the calculation instead of the max number you will be able to select a calculation to apply here by default is set to last and that is why earlier we had only the last row displayed but you can pick the first one averages per column maximum minimums and all sorts of calculations I would say let's keep it as show all next we have the pie chart options this one is mainly about choosing the circle to be pie-shaped or Hollow in the middle like a yummy donut boy this demo must be making everyone hungry right well you can also choose any labels that you want displayed over the slic like the percentage of a pie name of the field and the value in it so let's keep just the values now we have the tool tip options in other words what is displayed while you're hover over the pie you can set it up to show only one per field the one that you hover over or all the fields or no tool tip in case of choosing just one you can select the max width but if you want them all at once you can also set the order of the items and the maximum height now the legend section regards the information displayed at the bottom telling you which color is what you can hide it completely but if you keep it you can Define if it is displayed as a vertical table or a horizontal list if it is on the bottom or on the right and if you want to add the values or the percentage or both and if it is on the right you can make it also thinner or wider last we have the standard options uh here we can set things like units minimum and maximum in case you have percentage thresholds calculations if you want decimals change all the display names the color scheme and what to use if there is no value lots of options right but if you click on apply you will have your new and delicious pie out of the grafana oven ready to be displayed together with many more panels in your dashboard you can find out more about them on the videos here displayed on screen for now happy dashboarding and have a good one
