Transcript: hello graph Antics do you have groups of data that you wish that you could see the amounts of each with more impact at just looking at the numbers then graph's bar chart panel is your go-to in today's video I'll show you how to use this powerful tool to visualize your sales web metrics financials and more so let's get [Music] started the grafana bar chart panel lets you easily create bar chart that compare multiple data sets across various categories this panel is highly customizable allowing you to adjust colors labels and access to best represent your data it's a powerful way to bring Clarity and insight to your dashboards but it has some specific data requirements so why don't we check them [Music] first bar charts support only one data frame and it must have the fields or column names also at least one string field to be used as the category for the x-axis group and one or more numerical fields in other words it needs a single table preferably with just one row asides of the column titles and that the row has at least one text description but we can also have multiple rows which will be separated in bar chart groups the bar chart can also be used to display a Time series data set but in this case it is recommended to use the actual time series panel which can be visualized as bars for more information on that panel Link in the corner last in case you have multiple data sets you will have to transform or join them in a single one in the end to make things easier during this demo we will be using examples in CSV format that you can find Below in the video description but now that the bar chart data needs are cleared up why don't we create our first bar chart panel to visualize those different data sets we will use graph play to create our first bar chart panel the steps we will work as well in a local grafana setup to access grafana Play Link in the corner grafana place home screen is a dashboard here you can follow these steps to access the panel creation screen and add a panel now once in the panel editor we will set the panel type as a bar chart we have some bars here as last time I used these data source and type and well maybe you may have something else so to make sure you see the same thing we will use the grafana test data data source for more information on this data source Link in the corner now by default you will see a the random walk selected which gives us something like a Time series so to make this more understandable we will change the scenario to a CSV content and copy and paste the example data included here in the video description let's copy and paste first the single bar set yay our first set of data as mentioned earlier the names are defined by the column names in the first row pulling from the second row the title from the first Tex field and the values from the numeric parameters this is the most common format of data that you will use with bar charts but what if we have multiple rows well let's let's copy and paste the multi-bar data set and wow we have multiple bar sets as you can see each row of data creates a set of bars last we can also use time series so let's copy and paste the last data set time series nice we have something like a Time series but with bars we don't have too many measurements but if you had lots of it it would look like the random walk we had in the beginning again the time serious panel using bars is better if you work with this type of data so why don't we use the multiitem set again and move on to check some customizations we can do on the bar chart on the right side the first item that we have is the general panel options common to almost all panels in grafana if you want to learn more about them Link in the corner for now I will just change the title to happy hour bars demo now we have the bar chart options first we can select which field we will use as the xaxis by default it picks the First Column or field but uh you can choose if you want to use another column to define the xaxis let's remove it just to use the default now uh we have the orientation by default the bars grow vertically but you can paint it grow going horizontally uh I prefer the traditional outut of vertical below you can rotate the labels under the bars you can also change the space between the labels choose to show or not the values which are own by default you can also choose to stack the values on top of each other in a single bar or make them like a bar pie chart summing 100% if you choose to stack you will be able to change the mega bar width and the bar corners roundness but if we turn off the stacking you can modify the width of the bar groups the bars width the bars radius in the borders and also if you want to highlight the whole area of the bar space when hovering you can also choose a color scheme to be picked up per field but I like it to be the default lastly you can change the width of the lines around the bars also the opacity of the bar color and if you want to have gradients based on opacity it Hue or the color scheme but let's keep basics in the tool tip area you can choose if you want to display a tool tip with only one of the values so the one that you're hovering on or all the groups values or nothing when you hover over but if you pick all you can also order the values and find the max height or if you don't have them all you can use the maximum width now the legend is a section at the bottom showing what color is what you can hide it but if you keep it you can set it as horizontal list or a vertical table and also you can place it on the bottom or on the right of the parts where you will be able to choose how wide to paint it and you can also select what values to display uh next to each on the text size you can modify how big the values are going to be displayed but I like the standard size now in the aess section you can set if you want the Y AIS info to be displayed on the left on the right or just to hide the axis you can also add a title to the axis choose how wide you want it and if you want grid lines or the color scheme for the axis and if you want a vertical border line you can also change the scale to be linear logarithmic or cslog with their respective settings you can also centers the zero value in case your bars have negative values and you can set manually the the minimum and maximum values of the Y AIS last you can configure standard options such as units minimum maximum calculations if you want decimals change the display name choose a color palette or to Define what to do when there are no values but uh that's pretty much it clicking apply adds your bar chart panel you can make it bigger in your dashboard or add other types of panels if you want to learn more about other panels check the videos here on the screen but now you are an expert creating beautifully straight bar chart panels happy dashboarding and have a good one
