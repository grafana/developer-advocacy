Transcript: Hi, I will talk today about [Music] observability. But in in contrast to the Graphana guys that talks beforehand, I will not tell you what you should do to get successful observability. I will tell you a story what we did to get successful observability and they kind of have common ground. Um I will show you a little bit about Dart my company. Um the challenge we challenges we faced or we had in front of us with which brought us to the observability um topic. Um how we got it started and more important how we got it rolling and of course guys. All right. um of course the lessons learned and I also have a little bit of wish list to graphana um about improvements. All right. To my person, my name is Gag. I'm tech lead um for monitoring, that's where I started 20 years ago. Observability, what I did or started three years ago, and AI ops, what I'm doing right now. Um but more of that later, I guess. Um you're happy here to to join me on on LinkedIn. Um yeah, what is Starddev? Stay tuned. It's quite a nice one. I And Dard is a com a company for tax um related um um um jobs. And we are here we are a a community. So every um tax um tax consultant in Germany can be a member of start and I have for example around about 45,000 bosses or bosses yes and they they can be all um um members and our goal is we were founded in the 60s and is to always to improve the the the ex consultants alive. It started in the 60s with with buying the first house big room big um computers and it evolved on premise software and now today we are in the the cloud age as you can imagine I guess that's the same for most of you um the data centers the IT is the basis for the biggest or for the for the most parts of our products. There's a saying I think today nearly every every company is a IT company because every company exists in the IT world. So I guess the second part is the same for you also or you weren't here. Ensuring the performance and the avoiding outages and fast fault clearance at all time is from paramount importance. That's why we are here at the end of the day. This means better quality of our products etc pp satisfied customers and we want to save money because we have a higher uptime get more customers. That's the reason why. So, but times change and I think and I will also use the AI word in a couple of seconds. um it hasn't changed as fast as we see at the current time or as dramatical distributed and interconnected app services partners ecosystem s and clouds can fill a whole  bingo slide only with this um you have AI container containerization virtualization XY Z as cloud everything is cloud every every IT system uses is AI. I there are switches using AI. There are API gateways using a AI to do their jobs better. That's it's mindboggling. We at Dart are on a portfolio um change. We're moving back. We have still have some on premise software, but we're moving towards a cloud only um strategy. And as if that weren't enough, what we see here, we're doing DevOps mindset work model change also. So let's go. Why observability? We we are doing monitoring. I do monitoring for 20 years. We the challenge to ensure the performance of our products. Why? What is observability even? is only a new fancy word for monitoring. I thought about that and the conclusion I had with my teams I will present the traditional monitoring monitoring means I have a system who looks from the outside to monitoring stuff. Yeah. And what we have seen is that this traditional monitoring um approach will not work with the parameters I have just described. Try to monitor an AI. Good luck with that. Yes. Um so the idea at least what we uh see is what if the DevOps teams um enable their products their IT so they can indicate about their I would really say feelings no about their status about their that the journey through the data centers through the IT. For example, with the AI, I don't have to monitor an AI. I have to tell the AI if you happen to find something strange about your working uh conditions, please tell us, tell us with matrix, traces, locks, etc. PP please. new hyperscala um environment. If you have something strange happening um or you have um performance indications, please tell us. So we are shifting back from traditional monitoring from the outside to the um approach of the IT topics and this is all over the place for how the IT will tell about their well-being. So, like we heard beforehand, we go to Graphana, we get our credit card, put it on the table, and we buy Graphana Cloud, and we're done. No, of course not. We need to change the the mindset of our company. Good luck with that. It's very hard and we have to do something about the technology. It's less hard but still hard. So in the year 22 we we did an assessment of the state of observability at Darth um and very clearly we have seen we are not ready. We were not ready. application were the biggest issue because already in 22 big big micros service architectures all over the place. Uh we had some APM um toolings in in production but they didn't provide any meaningful value. So um we made an Lighthouse project. I guess you know what a lighthouse project is. Means you start small, effective, um show the value like like a lighthouse and then the rest um of the crew uh follows in and assignment was initiate initiating observability at our not getting it done. We we haven't got it done. I guess we will never get it done because it's a journey. it evolves like um the it evolves but we have initialized it that's kind of something we are we are proud of so how to get it started standards or as you can see standards standards standards use of industry standards wherever possible Why? If you use something like Linux for example, you get Linux experts everywhere. You get Linux. Every IT student has Linux experience or Kubernetes experience. If you use something like scenex who's here who knows scenex was what what's all right this was a Unix derivative of semens or from semens nobody knows this and so you don't get any um meaningful human resources or knowhow we wanted to use software as a service because I personally wanted my engineers to work on improving ing the observability product, not implementing Linux or Kubernetes patches. And of course, observability as code. This was one parameter. Um this means fully automable, automatable from the um the deployment pipelines or from run books. And that very um what we did um with a technology stack graphana cloud SAS SAS I just described why we we used a SARS but why Graphfana cloud so much better than for example data dog or dino trace etc. They are all cooking with water like we say in Germany. They are all good products. But Graphana is known by nearly every IT student on this world. Everybody who um on a university with IT related I guess knows something about Prometheus. We already had in the company very deep knowledge about the open source products graphana Prometheus etc. PP this made it a absolute nearly a no-brainer for us to use the already um um built up graphana cloud environments use the already built up know how and bundle it into a centralized product. All right. and and then lux struck lux struck you say yes because with the beginning of our of our project a little other project went into Java stable mode was called open telemetry as you know I guess it's after kubernetes the second most active project on this planet project and here um I don't know if you can see it but the contributors to this project all the big names Splunk, Cisco, Microsoft, Amazon, Dino Trace, Google etc people and this was very clear for me that this was the new thing because Dinatrace, Google uh Dino Trace, Splunk, Graphana Cloud will go Maybe, maybe not. But open telemetry is here to stay as industry standard. This is for monitoring. And I have 25 years under my belt. I never have seen such a shift and such a meaningful um event happening. Sounds kind of I want to cry but no it it is really it's it's a wonderful thing for the monitoring introduction of OBS um of open telemetry shout out here this is a little a very high level overview over the stack we went and we are centralized um observability um work stream or devops team. Our goal or our our product is to provide an observability approach or platform to our company. Um, of course, oh telemetry instrumented. We sadly have to use Farro as a proprietary um graphana solution because the front end um observability or monitoring from open telemetry isn't there where we want to have it but I guess they will go there then uh a standard open telemetry collector um infrastructure and what's a little bit different is every DevOps team here at Dart uses their own um Grafana cloud stack. Um that's the reason why we did that is because we want to supply every um DevOps team with their full end to- end um responsibility so they can do in their stack what they want. We need we need from Grafana a full bakedin role base and labelbased access control POS um mechanism for the whole um product family. All right. All right. Did it did it come up? Yeah. All right. because then we can um we can do via v we are labels and rolebased um control if this is really baked in into the core DNA and not only added um from time to time to different product um um products then we can maybe get rid of the different stacks and use one graphana cloud um environment. All right, now we are done. We have implemented the technology. This was the basis. This was the introduction, the first step. Now, how to get it rolling? And now comes the mindset part. Um because what we have seen a new tool a new solution if you don't get it to work and into adaption on your dev ops teams and it it won't do any good. This is our I think for us at least completely new approach to introduce an product an observability product into the company. Um the main challenges here are I have talked now about the platform. Uh you you can see what I've talked about here. Um just the the fat guys I have talked about the how important it is to use standards. SARS is nice. Please keep eye on the expenses. Graphana Cloud is not cheap. It's good, but it's not cheap. Um, keep eye on your expenses, aka the um the traffic. Um, the other quadrants are at least as important as the technology part. continuous enabling from the get-go. Use good um documentation to provide to your um users self-arning programs. We we made such many uh such big effort put in this topics to get the the idea done to to tell them how dashboarding is done. um at least the dat specialtities because I don't have to repeat what standard dashboarding in graphana is there you can go to YouTube and watch a video yeah um we are providing cost dashboards to our customers very important so they can see what they are um what they what they are paying from their data they are ingesting into the um Graphana cloud environment what's what they are paying very important then build a mindset I I love to talk about the product feature observability which has to be um which has to be a a big green checkbox after for example we have a product um the new um data product one this many many capabilities and one very important capabilities that it has the product feature observability. what that means um quite in a while I will show you we have uh I think we already heard about something how can we measure it how good a devops team is in um observability and that's where we introduced the system to measure the maturity level how good is observability because many say yeah we have observability everybody has observability observability you What? What? How good are you in your How good is your company? Yes. And I'm a community manager today nowadays. That's um I that's was the idea from the get-go also to bring together all the different DevOps teams at Dart so they can um exchange their their findings how they do dashboarding how they do instrumenting with open telemetries and give them a platform inside of Tatev where they can exchange their ideas can benefit from each other. Sounds a little bit like kumbaya I have to admit but it absolutely works. I would say 80% 90% the questions in from a from one um um DevOps engineer about I don't know Yava Yava instrumentation will be answered by another Yava DevOps engineer at Dardev who had the same um topics works like a charm. Um um though you can see what I mean about maturity level that's a very high level draft but for example level in maturity higher is better um have your apps instrumented do you use matrix status logs the dashboard in place and it goes on and goes on and level three is for example the observability success proved D is the observability product feature. Now we're talking about product feature regularly reviewed etc. PP what's level four I don't know I always say a little bit funny um providing world peace for example four or five um so so you get an idea what's also important is we as platform provider for the observability we want to know how good are we how satisfied are our customers so By every half year or so there is an assessment about the happiness of our customers. With customers I mean the users of observability inside data. Those are for example the the questions. Um and you can imagine like a smiley face sad neutral and heavy um is a is a scale. Cost transparency was a big thing where Grafana helped us because they provide all their costs of the stacks as as metrics and we have adapted that into our internal building system at Dart and give the costs transparent to our customers. And of course, needless to say, you want to be better and better and better. If you're doing stuff and you're getting worse and worse reviews, then there's time to take a deep um look into the mirror and think about you. Yo, lessons learned. The community approach from the outset allows users to get directly involved in improving observability. Um that's absolutely true because we we are not here even if our we are the observability platform team we don't know everything and you have to be open-minded use the knowledge which comes from the community and use it hear it and sometimes also say oh that's a good idea you have to do This this all don't be too proud. Yeah. Um cost transparency um implemented in this uh and to give this uh information to our customers um had an enormous factor on the how many um informations are sent to Grafana cloud. In former times, if this isn't directly re um um distributed to to the customer, they send whatever they want. Many many but if they have to pay for it, they are more sensitive. um our observability approach especially at this scale is it sounds kind of but it is cutting edge and I don't mean only the um the setting up of the technology stack I mean the whole thing how to get it done how to get um get it rolling at a company there are not many best practices about that um we used the professional service from Grafana Cloud and other consultants, they helped us in in some regards. But at least in in in our at our scale, we had to think many things completely new and didn't have much blueprints available uh in the IT world. And yeah, the last one, shout out to my observability team. Um I started this whole project with a very eager team. They had they were very they wanted this to work and they put effort in tremendous and yeah you you can move the the IT world. So observ observability done at least initialized we standardized the the technology stack that's a big reason why graphana cloud is used we used open telemetry we were very lucky that open telemetry got stable we enabled our devops teams we worked hard for the product features observability to get into the mindset of the product teams and we manage the community at the at Dart. So they come together and we measure the whole thing. So this was only the beginning. Um observability is the basis. Now we know what's going on in our IT and the next topic is for us AI ops. This mean take the informations which observability provides use it together with the ITSM data from a CMDB change information problem information etc PP and use AI algorithms to get really to the core of the root cause and impact on blast radius scenarios. But I guess that's a story for another time. Thank you guys and [Applause]
