Transcript: hi I'm Eddie kyaku a principal Solutions engineer at grafana Labs imagine managing hundreds even thousands of observability Agents or collectors spread across your organization's infrastructure it's a massive task especially when it comes to configuring updating and monitoring all these agents manually many organizations rely on tools like anible or terraform but these manual processes are timec consuming and can roduce errors even small changes can trigger lengthy approval processes making it difficult to adapt quickly Plus without centralized visibility identifying and resolving issues becomes a major challenge graff's Fleet Management takes the complexity out of managing large fleets of collectors with centralized control remote configuration and realtime insights it transforms Fleet Management into a stream LED hassle-free process now let's see Fleet Management in action the new Fleet Management Service gives me an overview of all the collectors running in my organization I can see each collector's unique ID status version OS and environment specific attributes like Dev tags or the owner's name you can view each collector's health status immediately making it easy to identify any issues at a glance it looks like my collectors are healthy except for one when I click on it I get a summary of its Health metrics recent logs and an alert explaining why it's unhealthy the alert shows that this collector has a remote right falling behind issue with details about the affected component there's also a remote configuration tab where I see all configurations available for collectors here I have a pyroscope profile for Linux collectors owned by TB it's not active but it can be activated with a click I also have several pipelines with open Telemetry signals for TMA which are currently active and apply to collectors that match specific attributes as well as a self-monitoring pipeline for Linux now let's create a new configuration I can set up a configuration paste it here and immediately see there's an error here I need a closing brace once I add it and click test I see the syntax is correct and I can proceed I can view my running collectors and apply filters to narrow them down I want this to run only on my Linux collectors and I can see a filtered view showing just Linux collectors owned by team A I can then save this setup go back back to the main view see my new configuration and use the toggle button to roll it out all matching collectors will pick up the update automatically ensuring consistency across your Fleet and if you ever need to adjust for cost or data needs deactivating configuration is just as easy this level control helps keep your monitoring flexible and efficient graphon Fleet Management makes managing observability at scale simpler and more efficient with centralized control over your collectors it minimizes manual effort and helps keep everything running smoothly and because Fleet Management integrates with other graphon Cloud components like mamir Loki and Prometheus you can get comprehensive observability solution that covers your infrastructure and collectors themselves Fleet Management is available now in grafana Cloud
