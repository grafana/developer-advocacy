I am thrilled to give you an update on **Grafana Assistant**. We're constantly expanding its capabilities, and I want to highlight a couple of my favorite features that I think you might like too.

First, **rules** allow you to control how the assistant behaves and what advice it provides. You can share interesting details about the nuances in your setup, which the assistant will consider when addressing other problems. If you've spent a long time establishing the best practices unique to your case, you can incorporate that knowledge through these rules. The assistant will take this information into account whenever it answers questions or tries to help users. This gives you full control, as you can write these rules in natural language.

Additionally, you can now connect **MCP servers**. If you want to interact with third-party systems, GitHub has a robust MCP server, and several ticketing systems now offer them as well. I believe AWS has one too, and we expect to see more emerging over time. If there's something very specific you want to achieve with the assistant in your environment, you can build a custom MCP server and plug it in, making those tools available to the assistant. This means the assistant can take action and fully integrate into your workflows today.

Another cool innovation from the team is **infrastructure memory**. This feature allows agents to scour telemetry data and build a map of what they observe. This map helps the assistant answer questions more quickly in the future, as the agents will consult this memory when making decisions. You can enhance this functionality with the integration of the **knowledge graph**, which allows the assistant to learn and improve the more you use it.

I am very pleased to announce that **Grafana Assistant** is now generally available, and we will also be announcing the pricing: **$20 per active user per month** starting January 26. If you're already using it, please continue to do so for the rest of the year as a thank you. We genuinely hope you find as much value in it as we do.

Lastly, **Investigations** is now in public preview, and we have more exciting features coming soon!

I am thrilled to give you an update on Grafana Assistant. We're ever expanding its capabilities, but I'm going to pull out a couple of my favorite things here, which I think you might like too. So, rules let you control how assistant behaves and what it does and the advice it gives. You can tell it interesting things about perhaps nuances that you have in your setup. Um, and we use that then when thinking about other problems or if you've if you've just spent a long time building up this is the right way to do things in our case that's unique to you. You can feed that in through these rules. Assistant will take it into account whenever it's answering questions or trying to help people. So full control here and you just write this in natural language. You can also now connect MCP servers. So if you want to interact with third party systems, GitHub uh has a good MCP server, quite a big one. Few ticketing systems now have them. I think AWS has one and of course you see them popping up all the time. So we expect more and more to come. Uh, and it's also quite cool if you if there's something really specific you want to do with assistant in your world, in your telemetry, you could just build a little custom MCP server and plug it in and then those tools will become available to assistant. So then it can do anything. It can interact, can take action. Um, you know, you can fully integrate assistant into your workflows today. Um, a cool innovation that came from the team was infrastructure memory. Um, so this is where agents will scour the telemetry beforehand and build a map of what it sees. This then helps assistant answer questions faster in the future. The agents will consult this memory um when making decisions. You can supercharge that with the integration with the knowledge graph uh with asserts and you just see assistant learning and getting better the more you use it which is kind of like fantastic. I am very pleased to announce Graphana Assistant is now generally available and we're going to announce the pricing also. $20 per active user per month. This starts January 26.
