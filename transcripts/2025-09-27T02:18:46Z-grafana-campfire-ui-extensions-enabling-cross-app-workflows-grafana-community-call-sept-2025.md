## Summary

In the September edition of the Griffana Campfire community call, co-hosts Usman and Matt introduced a discussion on UI extensions, featuring a talented panel including Andrew, Ben, Joey, and Marcus. The session focused on the potential of UI extensions to enhance user experience by enabling seamless integration of functionalities across different parts of Grafana applications. The panelists shared insights on how these extensions allow developers to provide renderable contentâ€”such as buttons, links, and componentsâ€”through a set of runtime APIs, facilitating a more cohesive user workflow without compromising performance. They emphasized the importance of collaboration and ease of use in plugin development, explaining how the UI extension system can help build powerful, user-friendly applications. The call concluded with a Q&A session addressing community questions about private app plugins, LLM observability, and resources for getting started with UI extensions.

# Grafana Campfire Community Call - September Edition

**And we are live!** 

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Grafana Campfire community calls, September edition. Today, we have a fantastic lineup of talented individuals who will discuss something very exciting called **UI Extensions**. I won't delve into the introductions today because my co-host, Matt, is particularly eager to present this topic. So, Matt, please take it away!

---

**Matt:** 

Thank you, Osman! I am indeed excited because UI Extensions allow you to plug in various functionalities throughout the application. When you're building your app, you can make components and menu options appear in different places. This integration enhances user experience by providing capabilities exactly where they're needed. 

We have a great team with us today: Andrew, Ben, Joey, and Marcus. Hello, everyone! How's it going? 

---

**Team Members:** 

*Waves and responds* Good!

---

**Usman:** 

Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Usman, and I work at Grafana Labs in developer advocacy. I closely engage with the open-source community, focusing on the data source side and UI extensions. You might see me creating tutorials, blogs, and videos, as well as hosting these calls with Matt. Now, Iâ€™ll pass the torch to Matt.

---

**Matt:** 

Thank you, Usman! Iâ€™m an engineer at Grafana Labs, working on the assistant and new agentic features. This area is exciting because it deals with non-deterministic models, much like how we work with databases. I collaborate with Ben on these projects. 

---

**Ben:** 

Yes, I work with Matt on the Agentic Assistant and have been involved with machine learning since I joined Grafana about four years ago. I also worked on the MCP server, which weâ€™ve discussed in previous calls.

---

**Matt:** 

Absolutely! It's been popular. If you're interested in it, check it out in our back catalog. Don't forget to smash that subscribe buttonâ€”Usman told me to say that!

---

**Ben:** 

Weâ€™re excited about the various ways to integrate with the assistant. It's a new paradigm for interacting with Grafana, and we hope to spread that across the platform. Joey, I believe youâ€™ve used the API we just mentioned. Would you like to introduce yourself?

---

**Joey:** 

Sure! Iâ€™m Joey, and Iâ€™m on the observability traces and profiling team. Right now, Iâ€™m working primarily with traces drill down, and I help with profile drill down, which involves many integrations weâ€™ll discuss today.

---

**Matt:** 

Great to have you, Joey! Marcus, you know a lot about extensions and extending the UI, donâ€™t you?

---

**Marcus:** 

Yes, I do! My name is Marcus, and I work with the community or platform plugin team. I handle everything related to building plugins and the APIs you interact with. We also conduct plugin reviews for the catalog and develop plugin tools, including UI Extensions.

---

**Andrew:** 

Iâ€™m Andrew, and I lead the drill-down group, which Joey is a part of. UI Extensions have been essential for us to complete workflows that span multiple parts of the Grafana stack. With hundreds of plugins available, the goal is to help users complete their tasks without worrying about which plugin theyâ€™re using.

---

**Matt:** 

Andrew, you've been on this call multiple times! We might need to give you something for thatâ€”maybe more work!

---

**Andrew:** 

Haha, I think thatâ€™s enough of a gift, but thank you! 

---

**Matt:** 

Now, letâ€™s discuss why extending the UI is so important. Marcus, what makes this capability so widely used?

---

**Marcus:** 

UI Extensions allow new features in Grafana to be delivered seamlessly. Users don't want to navigate through multiple apps to complete tasks; they need functionality available when they need it. 

---

**Matt:** 

Exactly! Weâ€™re all about providing a smooth user experience. What exactly are these UI Extensions?

---

**Marcus:** 

UI Extensions are a set of runtime APIs that allow plugins and Grafana to provide and consume renderable content from each other. Content providers can be either Grafana core or an app plugin. They provide renderable content, which could be links, components, or functions. Content consumers can be Grafana core, app plugins, or other plugins.

---

**Matt:** 

Can you briefly explain how the flows work?

---

**Marcus:** 

Certainly! We have two flows: **expose** and **add**. 

1. **Expose:** As a producer, you broadcast functionality or renderable content to anyone. The consumer requests this content from the provider. 

2. **Add:** As a producer, you target a specific area in the UI where you want to add functionality. The consumer can receive contributions from multiple producers.

---

**Matt:** 

That sounds powerful. Is there documentation available for these extensions?

---

**Marcus:** 

Yes! You can find it at grafana.com under the developers section, where we have API references and how-to guides related to plugin development.

---

**Matt:** 

Fantastic! Iâ€™d love to see some real examples of these extensions in action. Can you show us?

---

**Marcus:** 

Sure! Let me share my screen. 

*Marcus shares his screen and demonstrates an example of the assistant functionality.*

---

**Joey:** 

In this example, when you open the assistant, it can summarize your metrics, logs, traces, and profiles. It queries data and presents it back to you, providing insights into your workflows.

---

**Matt:** 

Thatâ€™s an impressive use of LLMs! It really enhances the user experience. Joey, could you walk us through the code for this feature?

---

**Joey:** 

Absolutely! Iâ€™ll share my screen. 

*Joey shares his code and explains how the integration works.*

---

**Marcus:** 

Itâ€™s great to see how we can expose components and link them across different plugins. 

---

**Matt:** 

We have a few questions from the community. Letâ€™s take a moment to answer them. 

1. **Can I create my own private app plugin with UI Extensions?**
   - Yes, you can create private plugins in a private repository and integrate them into your Grafana instance.

2. **Is there a concern that people could make a big mess with these extensions? How do we handle that?**
   - We encourage best practices and have some methods for restricting which plugins can add components. We want to allow creativity while ensuring functionality remains intact.

3. **Is there a guide or walkthrough to create a basic "Hello World" using extensions?**
   - There should be a how-to guide available on the plugin tools section of our site.

---

**Matt:** 

Thank you all for your contributions today! If youâ€™re building something with these extensions, please reach out to us. Weâ€™d love to hear about it. 

Thank you to our panel: Andrew, Ben, Joey, Marcus, and Osman. Itâ€™s always a pleasure. See you next time on Grafana Campfire!

---

**Everyone:** Thank you! Bye! 

*End of the call.*

## Raw YouTube Transcript

And we are live. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Griffana campfire community calls uh the September edition. Uh today we have a lot of amazing folks, some amazing talent which will talk about something very exciting which is called UI extension. But I will not do the intro too much today because I think my co-host Matt is very excited to present this one. So Matt, please. Yes, thanks Osman. I am excited actually because this is one of the areas that I think is such a kind of exciting thing to have available like extensions let you uh plug in different places in the app. So you're building your app and you can make bits appear elsewhere, menu options, components, different things. there are different ways to sort of integrate and um this is a way I've seen just sort of multiplies the value of things and it goes you're really giving the user the best possible experience give them a capability they need right where they need it. Um that's why I'm excited and you're right about a good team. We've got Andrew, Ben, Joey, Marcus joining us today. Hello everybody. How's it going? Got there and a wave. Good. Thanks. Maybe maybe you you can start introduce yourself. Maybe I can start. I didn't introduce myself. So we can do this and then we can jump to the to the topic so that everyone knows like who we are and what we do at Grafana Lab. We don't just uh do nothing. We do a lot of work. So it's it's it's it's more than just work. So yeah, it's about the community. So yeah, uh quick intro about me. My name is Usman. I work in the uh Grafana Labs in the dev advocacy area. Basically, I work very closely with the open source community. Currently I'm more focused on the data source side and uh I think with data source comes also this part of your extension as well but yeah um other than that uh you probably see me creating tutorials blogs or videos so and doing this calls with my co-host Matt and now I will pass the torch to Matt. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Um I'm a engineer at Graphfana Labs. I'm working on the assistant and the a new agentic stuff which is kind of very exciting and also different because you know you normally you in computers you would like put some data in a database and then you get that data out and it's the same with LLMs they're sort of somewhat non-deterministic and it really sort of depends on the mood they're in whether you can get them to do what you want or not which is kind of like I like that but it is weird when you think about it. I've worked well with uh I work with Ben on this, don't I, Ben? You've worked well with me. In fact, I would agree with that statement. Yes, I'm trying to I'm trying to write my performance review subliminally. Yes, I also work on on the same team with that on the new Agentic Assistant based things. Uh in the past, I've also worked on I've been on the machine learning side of things since joining Grafana about four years ago. Um, and I've also worked on the MCP server that we've released to open source. So, uh, I think we've discussed that a couple of times on this call actually. Um, yes, very popular actually. Yeah, that's it. So, check it out. If you're interested in those topics, go and have a look in the back catalog later and don't forget to smash that subscribe button. Usman told me to say that. Um, Ben, we also have there's a lot there there are ways to integrate with assistant. Maybe later we could talk about some of those. Yes, absolutely. Uh we are very excited about all of these different ways that you can integrate with the system actually. Um it's kind of a new paradigm for interacting with Graphana. Um and the kind of we're hoping to yeah just spread that across all Grafana really. So uh more on that later. Um I think Joey has I think Joey has actually used the API that we just talked about. Haven't you Joey? And welcome. Please introduce yourself. Thanks. I have certainly. Uh so yeah, Joy on the observability traces and profiling team work primarily in traces drill down at the moment. Help with profiles drill down and that involved a lot of the integrations we're going to talk about today. Nice. Welcome. And Marcus, you also do you know a lot about extensions and extending the UI, don't you? Uh some so my name is Marcus. I work I guess we are called the community team or the platform plug-in platform team. So basically I work with everything regarding uh plug um building plugins all the APIs that you interact with. Uh we also do uh plug-in reviews for uh all the plugins available in the catalog. Uh we yeah we we do basically a bunch of stuff regarding uh plug-in development. Uh we build a plug-in tools which you can use to scaffold plugins and uh yeah plenty of stuff and UI extensions is one of them. Nice. Yeah, very exciting. Andrew, you're a manager. Do you do any work? No, I don't know how I got invited to this call. Yes. Uh my name's my name is Andrew. Uh I lead the the drill down group which Joey is a part of. And uh you know UI extensions has been a key piece for us to complete workflows that span multiple parts of the graphana stack and application. Like we've got hundreds of plugins that that users can use and when you want to complete a user workflow like you don't really care about which plugin you're using. You just want to get the job done. So this is this is a tool that helps us really unlock that. I'm excited to talk about it with you all today. Yeah. And yeah, I'm I'm sorry if I'm interrupting, but Andrew is like two on two on this community call. The third time will be like a hatrick. We have to give something to Andrew. Maybe some more work. I mean, that's the failure of success, right? Just like get more work. Yeah. No, just don't just don't invite him again. Just don't invite me next time. That'll be the that'll be the gift. But Andrew, so it's interesting you have the drill down group and tell us a bit about how that's structured because I think something about the way we work at Grafana Labs means that these the way of extending each other's work becomes kind of important the way that we do that. Yeah. So I think like drill down as a group we focus on kind of these independent verticals of of each signal, right? Right? So there's a drill down app for metrics, for logs, for traces, and for profiles. And like yeah, you can say thinking about those in silos might hurt the user experience, but that's not really how we think about it. We think about user workflows and trying to accomplish a task with that vertical. So we don't stop at boundaries. Instead, we use UI extensions to complete the workflow. Uh, and I think that's a really powerful paradigm. like we we just want to move fast and deliver value to the users and we don't necessarily care where the functionality lives within the organization of Graphfana. We don't let that slow us down. Matt, you're muted. Yeah, that's a classic. Um that that must have happened. Is that is that is that never h is there a person where that has never happened? That's question. Yeah, it just never happened to you or it does happen every day. It happens all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, I just remembered this is live now. Um, what I was going to say is could we maybe start at what the problem is here? So, why is extending the UI so important? Why is it such a used capability, Marcus? Um, so as I guess Andrew talked about a bit, we uh new features in Grafana are uh delivered by building apps. Uh and you don't really want to navigate into a certain app to complete a task. You want that functionality to be available when uh when it's needed. So, um, UI extensions, the plan is to, uh, provide a way for, uh, plugins to, um, deliver that, uh, value when, uh, to deliver that functionality when when it's needed. I got a bit uh, I thought I was alone here for a second. That's why I was like, what? Yeah, because we've got cinematographer working on this at the same time. So, but I guess that makes it even more real and and I guess it's live. So, no, but uh yeah, I'm not sure if I answered your question. I got a bit lost there. Yeah, sorry about Yeah, if I if I make you nervous, that's why. No, no, no, it's fine. I wasn't I wasn't sure if I was still on the call or not, so that's why. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, um, yes, basically. So, we have all these different apps. We want to cooperate. If we tried to just build one experience, we'd probably be just moving too slowly. And the amount of coordination you'd have to do to to do that is just too great. And because we have these um we have autonomous teams at Grafana Labs, we're kind of moving, you know, quickly and different in their different directions. So I feel like yeah this is why extensions is really nice paradigm because it's sort of like a looser coupling between these things. Um 100% you get to release actually independently which is nice in isolation. That's probably one of the best the handiest things I think right and then you also own your code base. It's your responsibility. No other team needs to be bothered most of the time. Yeah. You just got to make sure that your extension is is is available. Yeah. Exactly. And we and we don't want to so we need a way to trigger or share or reuse functionality but we don't want to copy paste stuff into different repos. Um we want it to be be available only if that plug-in is available in graphana since graphana could be extended or set up in different ways. Um so there are some challenges uh that needs to be solved and hopefully we we solve some of them with UI extensions. Yeah. Great. What what are these UX the UI extensions then? Like what actually are they? Yeah, that's that's a good question. I have prepared some slides. Hopefully people will be uh have a better idea after that but I'm not sure. We will let's see um see if I can share my screen. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to do this. Uh so what are new extensions? So it's a set of runtime APIs that allows plugins and or graphana to provide and consume renderable content between each other. Uh doesn't say much maybe uh but that's basically the definition. Uh so we have a couple of different participants in this framework. So we have the content providers that's either a graphana graphana core so one of the core functionality or it's an app plugin. So basically you want to provide some kind of functionality uh or renderable content as we call it uh to some other part of graphana or a plug-in. So the content provider uh provides renderable content. It could be links, components or functions. So these are three t three different types of uh extensions that you can do. And then we have uh the content consumers which is basically the the last part of this flow. Uh and it's the uh it could either be graphana core or it could be app plugins h or it could actually be other plugins as well but this is what it mostly is. Um yeah so uh we have two different flows. So we have a set of APIs we call expose and we have a set of APIs we call add uh and they are kind of different depending on the use case. Uh you would either use expose or you would use uh the ad APIs. So the expose could you could think of it as you are broadcasting uh functionality or renderable content to anyone. So you as a producer, so the plug-in providing the renderable content uh are basically just saying, "Hey, I have a component or I have a a function or a flow." Uh anyone that's interesting, you can use it. You just fetch it at at this place. Uh and I don't know uh beforehand who is going to use it. Anyone can use it. So basically just broadcasting that functionality to out to everyone. Uh and then the consumer uh on the other hand it knows exactly where the content comes from because it needs to uh request it from a uh from the provider so to say from the producer uh and it will only receive one single thing. So if that producer is available. So for example uh if we have the machine learning plugin uh which provides u forecast uh capabilities if I want to consume that and I'm asking for it for the machine learning app to provide me that uh I only I'm only going to get that if the machine learning app is available. Then we have the ad APIs which is more of a uh as a producer you are targeting a specific place and you're adding uh functionality to uh a predefined place in the UI. Uh and from the consumer side of things uh which is where you define the extension point or where you render the extension point uh you don't really know prehand who is extending that po uh your uh extension point. It could be multiple plugins. It could be graphana. Uh you will just get uh multiple contributions from different producers. Uh so here we are trying to this is actually from the uh the latest documentation. Uh so we're trying to visualize uh the flow. So we have uh this is the expose one. You're exposing a component. So we have the content provider on this side uh creating some cool functionality or or uh it could be a button that triggers a flow or it could be uh like a rich page or it could be almost anything. uh you expose it uh to uh anyone basically by calling the expose component API uh providing it with an ID and uh you also pass the uh renderable content and then it's uh consumed uh by using a hook called use plug-in component and it could be used by multiple plugins uh but they will only uh return uh that single renderable content. Uh this is also made in a way uh where um the content provider will provide the context. So for example uh if you are in a dashboard and you want to share queries or template variables or data, you can pass that uh alongside the renderable content. So it can be consumed by uh the content consumer. And then we have the ad APIs. Yeah, feel free to jump in with questions. I'm going to run through this quickly so we can jump into a demo. Uh then we have the ad APIs uh which similar but uh the content provider uh they are the one that are adding a link component or function to a predefined uh area predefined place in the UI. Um and then the content consumer uh they are uh consuming the links components or functions and they will get uh multiple uh items back. So in this case plug-in A and plug-in B are uh adding content to a certain ID both graphana core and plug-in C which are consuming that content they will get three entries. So both the two from plug-in A and the one from plug-in B. Uh so I think that was like the trying to talk a bit about how the different flows work. So let's see some some examples maybe and and Marcus uh just for the viewers like uh these documentation uh is it available on the Graphana developer website plug-in development website? Uh yep. So you can find it at graphana.com if I can spell and we go to developers. Uh this is pretty nice. So basically you will end at the developer portal and then you can plugin documentation. Here you have a bunch of information about things you need to know about plug-in development. But you have a a section called UI extensions where we go into details. Uh we have API references and we have how to guides on this as well. Uh here uh let me see if I can find it. Yeah, but you can find everything here basically. Perfect. Uh so yeah, that was basically I'm trying to uh to answer the question of what your extensions are. Yeah. Well, I think you did and it makes a lot of sense. Um, I can see how this and and I should say also this isn't just for internal graphana people engineering stuff. This is if you are building something on top of graphana yourself, you get to use all these APIs. That should we should make that clear. Um, yeah, I would love to see some examples then. Do we have any real examples of um some of this in action that we could point to? We do indeed. Let me show you one example. I'll share my screen. Screen sharing is easiest with two monitors. Yeah, it already tells you it does, but that's no problem because I know what screen I'm going to share and I have it opened. Okay, now so our example that I wanted to show you was explain an assistant. So, if you haven't seen it already, you can open the assistant from the top right hand side of your Graphana instance if you have the assistant plugin installed and it'll open up this sidebar here. And in that sidebar, you can ask the assistant all sorts of questions. Um, and some of my favorite are about your metrics, logs, traces, or profiles, data sources. You can say, you know, what are my slowest traces? um tell me where uh profiles are taking longer than you know five minutes or 500 megs of resources for example in this certain cluster name space. So that's how that's a couple of the things the assistant does. But for us in this case and in the traces domain in particular um we have if you haven't seen it already the concept of a trace view which essentially takes a particular trace ID and queries that in the tempo data source and then it shows you that trace and all its child spans in a trace view. That's just the name of the visualization. But these views can be confusing, can be large. This one isn't too large. But every span does have a lot of information uh within it. So think of it like metadata for a service and operation. Like you've you've queried a website and you're seeing um the page load. There's a whole lot of queries that have to happen under the surface for that to work. So that's kind of the chain of events we're seeing here. So there can be a lot of information. Long story short, this uh plug-in component, and I'll show you in code how it works in a moment, it allows us to hook directly into the assistant to send over the query that we used to get this information to the assistant. The assistant will basically query that for us. It'll get the information from the query and then it'll summarize exactly what we're seeing. Um, so we I mean essentially you don't really have to think or search in the trace if you don't want to. It'll just summarize everything for you. It'll tell you where the bottlenecks are. It'll tell you which services are called the most perhaps if you have errors. Um, it'll explain why they're happening and then it'll give you suggestions or recommendations on what to do next. and you can you can jump to other places in graphana to perhaps make a bit more sense of the information or to to achieve more functionality to work with that information. So this is how it looks in the UI and that's how you access the functionality for this extension. It's it's such a before you go Andrew, it's like it's such a good use of LLM. This uh LLMs are really good at sort of um yeah translating from one one thing to another and being able to kind of keep the semantic meaning, but then also the fact that it can reason about what the data means as well. I think um yeah, this is kind of like really sort of game changer for anyone that's just new to tracing and just doesn't really know perhaps how to read this stuff or doesn't need to maybe now. Um right. Yeah, totally agree. Um I wonder what the next feature is going to be for us if we're just explaining away all the visualizations. Plenty of stuff in the pipeline. No hassle. Exciting. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. So, you see, so Joey, that normally that would be a very difficult thing to build that as a feature. Um, how difficult was that? And can you show us the code? I'd love to see it. I can. Yeah, it in fairness, it wasn't that tricky at all. There were a four caveats. Um, I'm actually gonna have to stop sharing the screen because I've done I've done the typical thing and I've shared a a window. is easier if you have two monitors, Jerry. Hilarious. Okay, so um yeah, so let's let's walk through how the code works and then maybe I can explain Yeah. some of the the caveats. There's to me there's only one caveat to be honest with you. Um okay, so like Marcus says explained in detail. Um we basically have to create a place where you can explain. Sorry Joey, can you just zoom in please? It's a bit tiny. Oh yeah, of course. No problem. Oh yeah, much brighter. Perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Um, so you have to expose a component or a link or a function. Um, the the the plugins team has allowed us to to work with all three. Links are basically you passing in a URL or something to open up in Grafana. Um, a component can be anything, which is what we used essentially for for the button over here. It's a it's a button component albeit with a link within. Um and you can also uh expose um functions as well and functions can be you know kind of anything really. It can be a link it can be a function it can be um or sorry a link component or it could be something else. So let's get rid of this annoying highlighting. Um, we have the assistant app and here I'm hooking into an exposed component in graphana which I want I'll show you. So the way to hook into an exposed component is to add it to your added components in your plug-in JSON. That was basically the caveat for me. It was where do I put it and what do I put into it. So it's it's if you're if you're hooking into something, it's added component, added link, added function. Um something that's defined elsewhere that I'll show you. And you also have to specify the target description and title. And just keep in mind, I guess obviously enough, the targets, if you hook into it multiple times, you have to use the exact same ID of the exposed component, but you also have to make sure the description of the title is the exact same. If it's not, you'll have a kind of an error. will appear uh for you. But you can the easiest thing is really to just step through the code because it's it's very quick to find where the issue is if that if that strikes you. But there's also um a very helpful page on graphan. I'll just show you very quickly. I'm going to just duplicate this where you can see all of your exposed um extensions and your links and your components. And I hope there's nothing private here, but I doubt it. um where you can just select you know the various apps extensions and you can see if they're working or not and that gives you a bit more uh a question uh so this is very interesting how you show the extensions in the if you go back like the list of all extensions so uh is is there like a special way to enable this uh feature to see what extensions are there good question I think it might be a feature toggle. We'll have to follow up on that, but it could also just be bundled into Graphfana by default. It's It's in Grafana by default, but it's only available when you run Grafana in development mode. I see. Yeah, because I have never seen um like uh in plugins and data a special section for extensions. So, I was wondering. Yeah. So I think this is something we provided just to make the developer experience a bit better uh when when you are iterating and and building the extensions because uh as Joey highlighted we have we have one big drawback and it's basically uh that you need to define the extension in two places. So the the place that you showed now it was the plug-in JSON uh but then also you have the the TypeScript part which uh you have here um we are work so so this is um I'm going to try to provide some background here uh this is this isn't isn't great and this is something that we want to resolve u in the first version of UI extensions you only needed to define the stuff in Typescript. Uh then we uh we launched with that uh everything went really well. People start to use it all over the place and we run into some problems with um performance uh because we needed to load plugins uh prior to them being used just to figure out if they are adding extensions or not. Uh so that's why we added the static information in the plug-in JSON because then we can prior to loading the plug-in actually evaluate and figure out which plugins uh to use where in graphana. So now everything is lazy loaded. Uh this is this is something that we're going to resolve. We have a bunch of ideas. Uh but in a perfect world uh you only work in the typescript uh part and the static part gets generated for you like during um during development time. So it just get bundled when you ship the plug-in. Uh we are not there yet but that's something that we we would like to end that end at. Um, that's a fair point. And and to be totally honest, between yourself, uh, Levi, and Jack, I've always found the one time I had a question, um, that you responded so quick, jumped on PRs, calls, we got through the thing, the last time for this in particular, the explaining assistant, I think it took us a day to figure out something that wasn't totally supported for our use case. Um, and it got sorted and merged quick. So, in all fairness, I have no complaints right now and the power is is it's it's pretty handy right now. Um, so appreciate that you get through things pretty quick. And just just to to close this full circle, so like Marcus was saying, you defined in the plug-in JSON and then you have the TSX or TypeScript file. Um the types are really handy as well of course for us for figuring out um the type of context that you want to pass between the place that's exposing the component and the place that's using the component. So you can pass in information like in this case um the context for us for the explain and assistant is you pass in a trace ID query, a time range and a few other small things. But just so I don't drag on too much, I'm going to end this pretty quick. Um this is the button that we return um to the extension that is exposed in core graphana. So we can pass in any component we want. We pass in this this fancy button open assistant button. That's the button you see here. And when you click on it, the action is basically handled in this. This is in the assistant. So because we're actually looking at something in core graphana, not the assistant, the um plug-in is exposed in core graphana. It's pretty simple to actually do this for panels in core graphana because again the team has made it really easy for us to just hook into this. It's a bit different if you're doing it plug-in to plugin. You have to have a match in the plug-in JSON file basically um in both plugins. But here the heavy lifting is taken care for us for for a panel. We just specify a new action and then in our core code where we want to show um other plugins who have hooked into our exposed components, we simply render them on screen like we do any other component. So you can see here we actually have use plug-in links and use plug-in components. We're currently using plug-in components. Please bear with me. The button um so that we can have this fancy button. Previously that's managed in the assistant app and is common across all of Grafana or will be where the assistant is used. Previously we just passed in a link and we rendered our own kind of button but it wasn't the same design as the assistant. So we want things to be uniform. So you can ignore the links basically. That's um something we'll remove pretty soon I'd say. But um yeah. So we have the extension the extension components from this pretty easy use plug-in components to make sure that you can actually hook into this use plug-in components again you can check this page or you can just jump through the code to be honest it's well commented and documented so it's easy to jump through and then when you have this object of the extension components you simply render them on the page like you do any other kind of thing this is just a util um function that's So that renders each of the components. And lastly, the context that I mentioned, it is defined in a type that you export and you can import in your other plug-in if you like. For example, in this case case, it's a pretty it's a pretty small type for the data source and then a slightly bigger type for the trace so you know what you're sending over. Yeah. Very cool. So that that button's kind of a twopart integration really. You're integrating into core graphana and you're also integrating on the other end into assistant. Exactly. Yeah. Which is kind of cool. Yeah, that's a power. Yeah, there you go. That's very cool. We do we do have a question from the community. Uh friend friend of the show Jungle Jolt is asking how can observability as code tie in with UI extensions like adding custom actions into dashboards. So observability is code. So I'd imagine that's um creating things that you can you can version control perhaps. So with with this approach um rather than having to repeat the process over and over, you can create your extension points or links just as components and they're versioned as um as any other kind of repository in in Grafana. They do usually have their own folders and directory structure, so they're easy to find, but they're versions in Git. Um so that's a way that you could you could you could see how it changed over time. And then of course when you're building your uh core graphana instance your configuration um uh can specify you you can specify right the kinds of plugins that you use with your core graphana instance and any plugin that you allow to run with your core graphana they'll come along with all of the plug-in links that have been um extended for them. And of course, you need to have fallback checks to say if um you're searching for links from a plugin, but the plug-in is not installed, then just return nothing. So, so nothing blows up. Yeah, thank you very much. Yeah, keep the questions coming. If you watch live, you can ask the questions in the YouTube chat. They'll show up and we will ask them, put them to our panel. So yeah, the ex the the seeing the sort of uh assistant and extending it like that gets quite interesting and I think it'd be nice to have a look a little bit more. Ben, maybe you could tell us a bit more about how else we can sort of do extensions and and incorporate assistant. Yes, I absolutely can. Um perhaps I can even share my screen. Yes, you probably you certainly hope so. Do you have two monitors? I wish I do, but I never use the other ones that's turned off. Okay, what have we got here? Turn it on. Uh, it's not going to happen. Could you make that smaller, Ben? It's not It's just not testing people's eyes like we promised. Better or worse? Better. This looks good. Sorry. What operating system do you use, Ben? Um, I'm on a Linux variant. There we go. Then this is a miracle already. The proper one. Um, so yeah, what I'm showing here is the the MPM package that we have, which is the graphana assistant one, which is gives you lots of utilities for integrating with the assistant. And a lot of these are actually based on UI extensions under the hood. Um, so what we what we provide is lots of different ways to interact with the assistant and also to provide additional context to the assistant. Um, so the the most basic ones are kind of ones there's something that that uh Joey mentioned already which is this kind of opening the assistant sidebar. So imagine you have a plug-in that is like you have some complicated visualization on there and you want to give the the user the ability to like ask the assistant about it. Adding a little button on there to provide that context to the assistant um so that the user can ask and then iterate and ask further questions and and learn about what's going on is is very possible here. And as well as as well as just there's a few different patterns for that that you can you can open it directly with the prompt populated. You could automatically send that message so that the kind of the flow starts already or you can provide it as like hidden context so that it's there in case the user decides to start start a chat organically. Um, so that's really useful if you you imagine a case where the user is on a dashboard, say, and they just want to ask a question like about the current page. It's really nice to not have to like make them describe what they see on the page. The assistant already knows that like it's looking at a dashboard with seven panels and they have these titles and queries and values. Um, so the context ones are really really useful as just kind of like ambient things that that like live there. Um, another couple of really powerful ones that I want to talk about is um, so the ability to use custom components and this would allow the assistant chat sidebar to render custom UI when it sees certain pieces of data. Um, at the minute it can already kind of render panels and it can render like log lines and queries and mermaid diagrams, that kind of thing. Um, but this API allows you to give it custom components to render. Um, which is really cool because it can suddenly like show a whole breakdown of a trace or a profile which you couldn't do before or anything that you have, anything custom you have. Uh, it kind of transforms the kind of classic assistant experience which is generally very text based like kind of a wall of text there into something a bit more visual and and nice and pleasing. And also useful like uh I can't remember how many words is a picture worth. Someone loads. It's loads. It's a thousand. I think it's a thousand, but I think sometimes it could even be more. Could be. I I think it could be more. I don't know what the current exchange rate is between pictures and words. How many megapixels? There's probably a dashboard dashboard for that. We'll have to look that up afterwards. Yeah, contribution is welcome. But that's very true though, Ben, because obviously seeing a graph of data is at a glance you get a really good idea of what's going on, which is kind of the whole point of Grafana in the beginning, right? Yeah, exactly. We're in this weird space where like things are transitioning to being very text based and in some ways that is a backwards move because as a user like you want to be able to you can immediately tell things from a graph or a panel. But yeah, when you have to read through seven paragraphs of text to get a bunch of bullet points, it's quite hard. Um, and back in the other direction as well, it's really hard to describe time series to models and LLMs in a way that they understand. So, if we have a nice way of rendering those things and providing that data to the LLM, which we're working on, but it's still a challenge, um, that that can be really really useful. So, watch this space. I imagine there'll be more more there soon. Yeah, very good. The thing that excites me the most about um these APIs that you just showed is the open assistant one, which is literally where you just open the assistant and provide a prompt. Now, you're right about the context, which definitely matters, but I've seen people in Grafana um build entirely new features just by putting a button in and having a prompt. Joey showed one great example of that. that's like a a new feature that is a kind of hard almost it would be probably not very possible not very easily before LLMs um and I think yeah I think the the possibilities that get opened up just by having that one method of just open assistant and say this to assistant obviously assistant has to be able to do that thing and um you know there's a lot of work going on to really uh level up everything Yeah. But um just so powerful. Yeah. Especially when you think about like some of the concepts in Gravana are are tricky. They're they're like there's quite a lot of levels of understanding that are required to be able to do them. And for example, like understanding alert rules is a classic like people really struggle and and I really struggle with knowing like what all the different config options are in an alert and when you're setting one up. If you could if you could just ask the assistant to alert on the current panel that you where you are and it would pre-populate that form for you and describe what all of the features mean like it can do that immediately and this is exactly the API that you need to be able to implement that feature and we have I think we may have that in a current release or it's current coming soon. It was came out of the last hackathon was really really good. But I think you you brought a very good point like other is still like a very very sophisticated mystery where you have to like like find the clues and solve the mystery where it's it is coming from because uh deep down not you have just have rules you have to define like some uh uh templates as well and there are also um how you say the paths like uh which other trigger with what like there's a parent child combination. So yeah, with assistant I think it it it can play a big game like to solve those mysteries and make it more simplified because the one who the person who created the alert knows like how the whole mechanism is working. But for the viewer who are just like hey I have an alert but I need uh help and I think refine assistant can be a good uh player in that part. Yeah. hopefully doesn't take all the fun out of it like I do when I go to an escape room with my family because for whatever reason I find them quite fun and easy maybe and they don't and I just basically ruin it for them so no one goes to rooms with me or maybe you have like a premium member who you go every day and like I know this door where it leads to I should do but I went to one once and the there was a binary puzzle on the on this door and I immediately recognized it as binary and went and solved it and that was like the last puzzle. So, it sort of ruined the game um because it just immediately got out. Um so, everyone was annoyed at me, but I've escaped the room very quickly. I feel like that's why we came. Yeah, people are strange. So, if you learned anything from today's call, don't go to an escape room with Matt. Yeah, which I don't I don't know that anyone was planning on that. Will you? Does anyone want You never know. Next off site. Next off site. I'd love that. It's a good idea. Um, no, not not now. You've ruined it. Yeah. So, Marcus, um, I want to hear more about these these exposed components. Um, okay, cool. Yep. Yeah. Uh, let's jump back. So, I I only have one monitor, so I'm going to do I'm going to do the same thing again. Uh, but let's see. Um, I'm going to do this instead. Maybe it's better. Can you see my screen? Yes. Okay, cool. So, now I'm in u I'm in uh asserts. So, we go here. Uh we have an app called asserts. Uh and I'm going to show all the all the nodes in my in my cluster. Uh I'm going to go to For anyone that hasn't Marcus, for anyone that hasn't seen this, what is assert? Uh that's that's a good question. I'm probably not the best person to ask that, but I guess uh uh No, I'm I'm definitely not the best person to ask about that. Yeah, I can. What is it? You haven't really contributed so far. I know. Why? Why is that? Uh it's like inviting a manager to this call might not be the best idea. No. So, yeah, I can I can definitely answer this. Asserts is essentially a knowledge graph that connects a bunch of disperate entities together through relationships. So I mean it's like your typical graph but it shows how different services might be related to each other. So like checkout service might call uh you know order fulfillment and then the order fulfillment might call payment and you can see that chain of connections in the graph and then if there's something that's gone wrong in in that chain somewhere you can see and pinpoint exactly what's gone wrong. And the beauty of it is like you don't have to use traces if you're just using metrics like you get access to to asserts and I think that's very unique to the knowledge graph. So what I think what we see here is basically all the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster uh currently. Um so uh in a search uh if you open this view we basically get jump into uh some more detailed information about this node. Uh since this is a a node in a Kubernetes cluster we get thrown into the Kubernetes tab. Uh the cool thing here is uh what I'm viewing now is the search app. So it's one single app. Uh but this view this entire view which is a pretty complex view it's uh from the Kubernetes app which is a totally different app. Uh and everything is working. Uh you can apply different time ranges. It's going to just work out of the box. Uh we can go to there's also a link here. So we can go to opening Kubernetes and you get thrown into the Kubernetes app which is has some more details and some more functionality if you want to drill down. Uh but let's go back here again. Um so uh assert is using the uh use component and they are fetching uh an exposed component for the kubernetes app and they are rendering it here. Uh which is pretty cool and it's fast. uh if for some reason the Kubernetes app would have been uh disabled or not available in this graphana instance this tab would be uh gone uh just seamlessly and all the rest would function uh as normal. Uh another cool thing is so I said that this was from the Kubernetes app and the Kubernetes app they are actually uh using uh functionality from the machine learning app which is a different plug-in uh and you can use that to predict uh in this case we have CPU CPU usage so I can get a prediction so uh now we are uh rendering a component from the machine learning app to get the prediction over uh the CPU uh a couple of days uh in the future. Uh which is pretty cool. Um let me see. Codewise uh I'm going to switch over to the uh the presentation. I don't have this repo cloned locally. H So let's do that. And let's go here to the presentation. A question markers uh while you share the screen. So uh the graphana asserts is it uh also available in the graphana free tier cloud account? I believe oh I'm not the right person to answer that either. Okay, Andrew. I don't know if I have this answer. I don't think it currently is, but I think they're working on it. I I'm really not sure though. So, uh that would that would be a question we have to take offline and get an answer definitively. Yeah. So, but uh let me see I'm in the wrong place here. So, uh exposure component. Cool. So uh here we have um this is kind of interesting because I'm showing the totally wrong uh example here but anyhow it's the same thing. Uh this is actually from I'm going to show you another example then maybe instead so you can actually see the proper code for what I'm uh viewing. Uh if that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Uh so let's jump back to Grafana again. Uh okay cool. So uh let's go over to Kubernet Kubernetes app because we have these things all over the place. So as you see a button appeared here and this is uh insights which comes from the search and the knowledge graph. Uh this one is rendered by uh exposed components also. Uh so for this one I have a code example. Uh so I'm going to switch over again. Sorry Marcus. I'm going to blow your mind when I teach you about tabs. Yeah, but I only have one screen otherwise I would Yep. Uh but okay. Uhhuh. Uh I don't think I can share the entire chrome though. Um but okay. Uh so entity assertion widget that was what we saw. Uh so they are uh fetching the component using uh the use plug-in component function and they are passing in the ID for that component. Uh they will get that is loading and the component back. So uh while it's loading then basically not going to show anything or if the component isn't returned back. So that could be if a search is not available for example uh then they're not going to show that button basically otherwise they're going to render that button and that's what you need to do at the consumer side. So this is in Kubernetes app in this case and you also need to add the static metadata in the plug-in JSON that Joey highlighted. Um not the best but yeah still needed. Uh and then in the asserts app uh they basically uh just call the expose component. Uh they provide ID, title, description and then the component that they want to expose. So in this case it was the button that I showed you. uh and they also need to define uh bit of static metadata but in this time it's extensions and exposed components uh and that's basically all you need to do um to get this up and running. Yeah, it's not much is it? Uh it's a couple of steps too much but it's um yeah you're working on making that faster then easier even uh we have something on the backlog on the backlog to to remove uh as I said before the the static data part so you basically just need to define it in in Typescript um when that's going to be delivered I'm not sure but but just putting it in two places is all right it's not that bad is It's better than copying and pasting code all over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love a copy paste, me. Um but but I love the obsession over making it easier and easier for everyone. Like even just having it in two places and we're just not happy with that. We want to make it even simpler and simpler and simpler. Yeah. Yeah. But what we what we what we learned is I think you always said that also like there's a lot of people jumping on want to do build something cool with your extensions and sometimes they get stuck on not really figuring out what to put in the plug-in JSON and that's enough to like enough threshold to get people to I'm not going to use that. So um that's why we didn't start with having things like that because we wanted it to be simple to get them going but uh as I said performance-wise we needed to basically we needed that one because it yeah we we can't load all the plugins when you load Graphana because the customer is going to be not that happy. Yeah, I can see that definitely makes sense. But um and I love that uh you yeah you're sort of obsessing over that making it easier. I wonder if cursor knows to put it in those two places or any of the models if they just do it properly. We should try. Yeah. Um I think we we we have still some time like about like six minutes more and we have some questions which we got from the community. So how about if it is okay for everyone to uh try to take those question and answer them. Is it fine? Yeah. Let's try try our best challenge right away. Andrew's got to Andrew's left so we can't just put it on him this time unfortunately. Okay, they're all good. Uh I will just copy paste this in the comments so that the viewers can also know like what was the question and give me a moment please. Um yeah so this is the question uh can I create my own private app plugin with the UI extension? I think so. Right. You can you can create it in like a private repo and then you can just hook it into your um graphana instance. Yeah. Nobody needs to know about it. You don't need to make it public as long as the functionality is available everywhere. So you can use it if you have a I I I reading this as someone developing a private app plugin. Yes, it's it's available for everyone. Yeah, that's good. That's cool. So it's yeah I mean honestly like the that component plugging components in changes everything like the list links were good but obviously then the con the constraints were on the other side of what that UI how it presented. Uh is there a concern that people could just make a big mess? How do you deal with that or how do we think about that? Yes. So I I guess um there are some best practices to find in in our docs. So kofana.comdevelopers and and into plug-in tools. Uh but what we try to get people to do is to when you are uh rendering uh content from a producer, try to be smart and try to limit the space it can take. But on the other hand, we want people to build cool stuff and to iterate and to deliver great value. So currently there are not that many restrictions. Uh you can um restrict which plugins that can um add uh components to a extension point. M so there are ways to do that but but currently it's really open. Um we would rather have uh too many uh extensions than none. Uh if it gets a problem we can probably do something about it. Figure that later. Yeah. And we we have so I'm going to say something regarding security. So we have we have put some efforts into the context that we share between uh the different apps. Uh we have uh put some effort into making sure that you can't really tamper with the data being passed between the different plugins. So u plugin A cannot really uh intervene or do anything with the data that gets passed to plug-in B or C. So they are isolated. So Mhm. those kind of concerns we we have had but uh the the stuff that I'm thinking you are asking about no it's more it's open. Let's let's do fun stuff with it. Yeah. How about this one then? Um, Jungle Jolt says, "Marcus, very pointed. I'm trying to build an LLM observability plug-in. Latency tokens cost errors. Do you see real value in this for Graphana or is another observability area more impactful?" It's an interesting question. We we actually look at latency in traces drill down um in Graphfana. I'm not sure if this is crossing over what you're asking here. Um, but I I think they're talking about building observability for LLMs, right? To to observe LLMs. Yeah, sounds like an interesting plug-in. Uh, I don't know about a plug-in like that so far. So, what do you like? I guess uh the question should probably be asked to uh maybe Matt or or Ben, which um works more. Um I would always say Yeah, I would say definitely build things like that. There's there is a gap uh totally isn't there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Agreed. I don't I don't think we have anything quite like that right now and I think that would be really useful. Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to be able to see that. Um, even better existing instrumentation, I suppose. Um, but yeah, it sounds sounds really good. I mean, you want to monitor the as as when you start to use that kind of functionality more, you want to monitor that information as well. So, if there's a plug-in to make that easier, why not? Yeah. And then, is there a guide or walk through to create a basic hello world using extensions? That's another question. Uh yeah, there should be one on plug-in tools. Uh we used to have uh an examples repo which had a bunch of uh code examples. So basically small plugins that you could just clone and just run and you would have the bare minimum to get it up and running. Mhm. Uh I know that we discarded that repo or we we removed most of the examples because we didn't really had time to uh keep them up to date and spend enough time to for them to actually be um uh valuable and uh you know show the proper things using the latest stuff. Um but there should be a how-to guide. Uh otherwise you can always reach out to us via the community slack or on the for forum. Yeah, I will I will definitely um say to the audience like we have a graphana uh uh community forum where we have a special section for the uh plug-in development and Marcus and uh other uh people who are in the plug-in development area. They can answer all of your question very uh very quickly and very helpfully to get you started. So check that out. Join the community forum as well. And um and my last shout out is also for the graphana. I I have recently got some questions on like is it available on Grafana cloud? Yes. Uh uh if you are a Grafana cloud user, you should definitely check that out as well um to to understand how it works. So yeah, that's all. Yeah. Well, unfortunately that is all the time we have for today, but thank you so much. Now you know how to extend Graphfana's UI. Plugging features in across the suite of apps helps you multiply value, helps you meet users where they need you. Um, if you build something with this, by the way, do ping us and get in touch because we'd love to hear about this and u maybe we'll like to talk to you about it too. Thank you so much to our panel, Andrew, Ben, Joey, Marcusman. Always a pleasure and we'll see you next time on Grafana Campfire. Yeah. Thank you. Byebye. Now you have to hold a smile. Hold a smile till it until it's off.
