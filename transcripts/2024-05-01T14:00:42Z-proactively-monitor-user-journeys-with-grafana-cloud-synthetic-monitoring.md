Transcript: hi everyone my name is Mark Meyer I'm the product manager for testing and synthetic Cal Labs today I'm here to talk about synthetic monitoring so synthetic monitoring is important right it can be the first signal to us if our customers can or cannot complete critical workflows within our app and it's critical that we're proactive here because a poor user experience can be harmful to your business existing synthetic Monitoring Solutions are very manual to set up and thus hard to maintain scale debugging in existing Solutions is also cumbersome and time consuming so let's talk about grafana Cloud synthetic monitoring we've built graphon Cloud synthetic monitoring to help you focus on monitoring your apps and services while also reducing toil typically associated with synthetic monitoring in the end we want to help produce a faster meantime resolution for the apps and services that you are monitoring all right enough talk let's take a look at Finos synthetic monitoring so I'm logged in here to graphic Cloud I have my main dashboard set up for all my synthetic monitoring checks that are running we can clearly see at the top uh green for checks that are running and good red for ones that may be down we can see State reachability latency as well as what we're hitting and the type of check being used further on this homepage dashboard we can see error rates by location percentages as well as latency across all of these different checks that are running graphon synthetics supports a variety of different check types we have things such as HTTP ping DNS TCP and trace route we've also just introduced multi- HTTP and scripted checks these checks are based on k6 open source and allow you to complete a user Journey as part of your workflow in synthetic monitoring with all of these checks you can also manage them via terraform making your as code workflows super easy so let's take a look at a a check that I have running so I have this scripted demo check running running against our Kix test API let's first take a look at what I am testing so I've set this check up of course given it a name set locations for where it will run set my frequency for how often it should run and then down in the script I've written k6 JavaScript to help Define what I'll be testing and in this script I'm making a few requests I'm going to post to log in I'm going to post to create a crocodile against our crocodile API we will then delete that crocodile and then finally we'll log out this describes what my user Journey might be for users that I want to make sure they're able to do uh every single day and the nice thing about all of this being a k6 script uh if you start to use k6 for performance testing or already Ed it for for performance testing you can simply reuse your test scripts for both of the products let's take a look at this script and see how it's doing all right so here's the results from my scpt script over the last 6 hours this check has been running we can see uptime is 100% reachability is 97% so while all of my checks are able to reach the end point some of the probes are failing as we scroll down we can look at our assertions we can see that hey we have successes across most of our journey but in one case weren't able to delete the crocodile so that's interesting maybe that's something we want to look into we have other information available such as the distinct targets I should you the 4 HTTP requests that's what we see here duration by probe data sent received you can also look at the individual HTTP requests to see how they perform over time maybe we see here our login 7,000 milliseconds hey that might be something I want to look into why do I have such a long response time that doesn't feel right let me dig in to dig deeper into What's Happening Here we could take a look see if there's anything any interesting bits of data we can also explore this panel or copy the Json and and bring it over to another dashboard hope you enjoyed checking out the graan synthetics be sure to check it out and let us know what you think thanks
