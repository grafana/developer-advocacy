Transcript: Hi there, Tom here. I want to talk to you a little bit about
some of the findings from our third annual observability survey.
We had over 1,200 responses, but I just want to focus in on this
executive involvement finding from the survey. So let's have a look. So
one of the questions we ask is, "At what layer in your organization is
your observability strategy being led?" Right? And the most common
answer now is CTO level. And that kind of surprised us,
right? That's a big uptick, a big acceleration from last year. We're also seeing organizations and people
that answered questions with C-suite engagement had much
stronger adoption of more advanced techniques. So these things
like SLOs, things like profiling, distributed tracing, things like unifying your application
and infrastructure observability. We find this interesting because we're
also seeing the same pattern at Grafana Labs with the adoption of our technology.
And previously Grafana very much something for the early adopters and
innovators for the tinkerers at the grassroots of the organization.
Those that want to put together their own observability
system and build their own dashboards and learn these fantastic query languages. Now we're starting to see Grafana be
something that CTOs are interested in, that they have executive level
dashboards reporting on business KPIs, and we see the same trend in
adoption of our technology. But it's great to see that
this is a wider industry trend. Let's dig into a little
bit more of the data. The other thing we're starting to see
is a much broader adoption of SaaS. So there's been an uptick in companies
responding that they're taking a SaaS only approach to observability. That was good to see considering
we also sell SaaS software, but I can understand why
people are doing that. These modern observability platforms
are getting increasingly complex, increasingly hard to operate, and businesses are looking
to focus on their core capabilities. So they don't want to
do the kind of undifferentiated heavy lifting of running
observability platforms. So it makes sense that we were
seeing more adoption of SaaS. So another one that stands out is how
central observability teams are becoming both more prevalent and more mature. We see this as a trend kind of correlating
with the adoption of SaaS because these teams are now moving on from
focusing on just operating a big time series database or a log aggregation
system and more providing best practices, evangelizing for how to get
the most value out of said systems. And this counts because they're
not operating them anymore. The cycles they have from freeing
up the operations over to
a SaaS vendor allows 'em to focus on getting the most value
out of that technology and driving its adoption through a wider
organization. So lastly, I just want to talk about distributed
tracing. So we saw companies with that exec level buy-in for their observability
strategy were much more likely to have a consistent distributed tracing story. We also saw tracing like squarely
now as the third most popular signal and quickly catching up to
metrics and logs. But lastly, I was also quite surprised to see
it's companies with those central observability teams that are
really leaning into tracing
somewhere where you can lead for best practices, somewhere where you can identify
the dead spots for tracing and maybe come in and repair some of that.
And this makes a lot of sense. I'll also say we are seeing
an industry trend of a shift for instrumentation more towards a
platform responsibility with the rise of technologies like eBPF and Beyla
really driving the ability for your platform to automatically instrument
your code without the developers involved. So it makes sense that that would come
from a central observability team and that they could lead that effort. And
that's one of the key things that unlocks a lot of the value in
distributed tracing. So yeah, that's some of my thoughts
from the observability survey. If you disagree with any of
my kind of analysis here, or honestly if you have
alternative explanations for
some of these trends we're seeing, please do leave a comment
below. Like and subscribe, I think is the right way to say this.
This is my first YouTube video I think. But yeah, and if you want to know more
about the data, go to grafana.com. We've got this really cool interactive
dashboard that you can drill into the data on play.grafana.com,
and thank you for listening. Okay, so let's dig into
a few more of the data. I mean, technically that is correct because my
wife always likes to tell me that data is a plural, or data are a plural, rather. But I just think Americans would be
freaked out by the English guy if he says that.
