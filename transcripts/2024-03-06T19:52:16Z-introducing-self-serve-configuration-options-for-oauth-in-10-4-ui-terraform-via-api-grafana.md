Transcript: [Music] hi there I'm M and I'd like to share more details about the SSO settings UI and the API and and the terraform provider for now all of the settings of the O providers are configurable through terraform or via the API but only the generic o integration can be configured completely from the UI all of the other uis are available but those are not complete and only the part of the settings can be configured however we are working on adding all of the configurable settings to the rest of the providers SEMO support is coming at the end of this cter because we need to align the seml UI to the new API plus we need to refactor the seml provider a bit to make it work with this new API let's talk about how to use this new functionality and new uis so on the cloud portal if the SSO settings API feature tool is enabled for the instance then after opening the advanced setting admin settings yeah the admins will be redirected to the graph instance to configure the selected provider for example I selected GitHub and click on configure yeah so currently I'm on the instance uh GitHub configuration page so when you navigate to the settings page it shows the current settings of the integration for example if you previously set the integration up from the config file then it's going to show the same values here as you can see I have the ABC which is not correct this is coming from the config file if I would like to save it then I'm going to get a an error and I need to change it to for example 1 two three because the GitHub integration only accepts integer IDs then I can save it okay let's talk about the gener to UI which is a new one so when for example on the gener UI when you click on SA save then the API saves the current configurations with all of the settings into the DB and after that changes in the config file won't take effect so it means the settings are coming entirely from the DB if you'd like to reset the settings and use the settings from the configuration file you need to click reset technically it removes the over done settings from the DB for the rest of the uis for example the GitHub UI uh when you click on Save then the API saves only the configuration settings that are visible on the UI as you can see there are four five visible settings enabled client ID client secret team IDs and a load organizations so when I click on Save uh the API saves only the configuration settings that are visible on the UI and the rest of the settings are coming from the configuration file this behavior is temporary and the new uis will have the same behavior here as the gener co out and one more thing to note so the gra.com provider is not configurable from this uh UI so you need to use the admin gra.com portal or gcom CLI to update the gra.com uh provider thank you
