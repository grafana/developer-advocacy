Transcript: hello graph Fanatics wait you are not yet a graph fanatic that is because probably you are looking for ways to get your own grafana instance so that you can become a grafana being that the case you came to the right place as today we will check all the ways in which you can get grafana in all the supported operating systems and platforms grafana is an open source analytics and interactive visualization web application such a mouthful no it can produce charts graphs alerts and many other things when connected to data sources it runs in multiple OS and platforms such as several Linux distributions Mac windows and other platforms like Docker and kubernetes if you like installers to get your software grafana has these ones for multiple platforms as well you can also get grafana by downloading a compressed file containing all the binaries needed to execute and start grafana with simple commands but if you want to skip all these and just start playing with grafana you can use grafana cloud you can easily create a free account to get started Link in the corner but as you are watching this you may want to know how to do it yourself so why don't we begin with all the automatic installers per operating system and then after that we will go over the binary ways if you are interested Ed in a particular Os or method use the chapter down here in the video to quickly jum there so now let's get graph [Music] native first we will go over the automated ways in which you can install grafana we will clear the Linux distributions such as deian and Ubuntu red hat or Fedora sua then Mac OS and lastly windows [Music] deian and Ubuntu environments can automatically get grafana in two ways first the most straightforward is to use an AP repository this has some advantages like easy updates but before we run the installation command we may need some prerequisites Keys repost and other things we will be getting all the commands from the grafana installation page Link in the video description for easy copy and paste so to start Gathering items in your dbn or to command line you must first get all the needed packages copying and pasting the first command in the page Soo AP get install that's y AP transport https software properties common and W get this step takes a bit as it downloads several things but after it we must import the gpg key copying the next command it is a long command with a lot of things first with a Pudo mkg to create the directory then a w get to get all the files needed and then to put them in the right location the next step is to add repost or stable or beta releases I want a stable so let's copy this one Eco with all the information inside then we can put it in a list next we need to update the packages with Pudo AP get update after you execute this command this one can also take a little bit if your packages were out of date and well after the updates are done if any we can finally run the installation by executing Pudo EP get install grafana that will install the OSS release if you want the Enterprise release just add Dash Enterprise at the end like in the download page after the process downloads a few things shows some messages about the installation and some prompts the system will show some commands to run grafana server to start grafana or to configure it to run automatically I want just to start it so let's use this command sud sudo being system CTL start grafana Dash server we just have to wait a second then then we can go to our browser and access Local Host 3000 to see our graan environment starting very straightforward right now we just have to use our old admin admin user and password to do any initial steps now if you want to install it by downloading a Dev package you can easily do it by accessing the download page and selecting the version uh Enterprise or OSS and if you have an armm or AMD processor the most common is AMD and only says Linux here first as the command says we need to make sure that we have all the dependencies by running pseudo APG get install Dy at user live config one and M USL next after this executes we must download the dep file to get it we will copy and paste from the Ubuntu and deian section as well well for AMD which is the one that we are running we paste the W get command with all the URL and the download will start now that we have the indicated dep file we can execute it to install raana by copying and pasting P sudo D pkg-i grafana Enterprise with the version and now that we have the indicated Dev file we can execute it to install raana by copying and pasting the Pudo dpkg command and run it make sure that the command has the same file name as the one that was just downloaded in the previous step then after some downloading progress and prompts we can use the command display to configure the grafana service to start automatically or just it once and that's what I want to do so let's copy this command Pudo Bean system CTL start grafana server and nice this will start grafana we can now open a browser with Local Host 3000 and we will see grafana running we have just to type our admin admin in user and password and we will be ready to play in deian or Ubuntu in red hat and Fedora there are two ways as well to install grafana you can automatically run from the RPM repo with a dnf or get the RPM and execute it yourself first to use the dnf we will get commands from the installation page Link in the video description the first thing that we must do is to get our gpg k for that we will open a command line and copy and paste the W get command that will get the GP GK and then the pseudo RPM command which will import the gpg K next we need need to create one file in this specific location and paste some code needed in it so first we will create the file in the location Etc j.o. D and the file is graph. repo for this we could use the commands sud sudo touge and the name of the file to create the file and then to open it and paste the content we can use sudo V and then the name of the file to open it and edit right here you can use other editors than the or creation commands but this is the one quickest that I liked let's paste in that file the following code that you can get from the installation page again Link in the video description once you pasted it save the file with colon WQ and exclamation mark then return to the command line and to run the installation command you can copy it from the web page again sud sudo dnf install grafana this one will install grafana OSS but if you want the Enterprise version you can use the same but at the end at Dash Enterprise to get it after some downloads installations and prompts confirmed you will see some commands to configure grafana service to run automatically but I want these to be run only once so let's use this command to start it now sud sudo be systemctl and start grafana server. service waiting a few seconds now we can go to in a browser to Local Host 3000 and use the good old admin admin for user and password and there you have it you are ready to play with grafana from red hat or Fedora now if you want to run the RPM manually you must go first to the grafana download page again Link in the video description once in there select the version then the Edition and select armm if you have that system or CPU otherwise just select Linux then scroll down to the red hat sentos r e l and Fedora and copy the pseudo yum install command paste it in a command line and execute it after the code progresses and prompts you the installation will have finished and you will see some commands in which you can configure to automatically start grafana server or to run it manually only once we want to run it only once so we will use this command at the bottom after a few seconds you can open a browser and go to Local Host 3000 and there you will have grafana ready to play in Red Hat RH L Santos or Fedora again just use your admin admin user and password and you'll be inside ready to [Music] play to install grafana on zus it's sus not Susi not sus is sus check it out well in Su you can install grafana using the RPM repository with cyer but first for that we need our gpg K so let's do that in a command line by copying and pasting from the installation page the W get command that you can see here on the screen first the WG to get the GP gpk and then the pseudo RPM to get imported after that we need to add the grafana repo with cyper by copying and pasting again from the same page PSE sudo cyer add repo and then the grafana information after that we need to copy and paste the installation command sudo cyper install grafana this command will start the grafana installation for grafana OSS if you want the Enterprise version again just add Dash Enterprise at the end after after the download and a few prompts uh finish you will be able to start grafana with some of the displayed commands at the bottom either to put automatically or just to run once with this command I want the command to run once only so I'm going to grab it and paste it after that a few seconds later you can open a browser to access Local Host 3,000 and with that you can use the good old admin admin user and password and you will be all set to use grafana in zusa [Music] to automatically install grafana in Mac OS is as easy and as simple as just a command using home room if your system doesn't have home R yet please install it just by following the link here in the corner once you have Homebrew in your Mac OS installing grafana is really simple as simple as just opening here a command prompt and typing the following Brew install grafana that will start some installation and download processes which after it finishes you will be able to start grafana with Brew services start grafana you may get a security prompt to provide some access but that's it after that you can open a browser and go to Local Host 3000 and there you have it grafana type admin admin as user and password and you're ready to start playing with grafana on your [Music] Mac in Windows systems you can get grafana through a traditional MSI installer to get the installer go to the grafana download page select the version and Edition that you want and below click on Windows then click on download the windows installer to download it once the installer downloads just double click on it and give it some permission to run and follow up the prompts in a traditional next next next as usual that should work and clicking okay at the end after the installer finishes grafana will be already running as a service so you can just open a browser go go to Local Host 3000 type admin admin as user and password and grafana will be ready in your Windows operating system so that you can start playing with it now if you prefer to get grafana through binaries and all of their benefits such as controlling the files location moving them around or not needing too many permissions to run it well it is super easy on all of the operating systems first we need to go to the downloads page there you can select the version and the addition once selected choose the operating system while you will need the binaries either Windows Mac Linux on AMD or Intel processors or if you have Linux on an armm processor binaries will work on all the Linux distributions as long as you choose the right CPU so selecting your version edition an operating system scroll down to the stound AL loone binary section you can either click on your browser to start the download or type what's indicated in your command line to start downloading the compressed file W get with the file that you want to download both of these will start the download process now just make sure that you know where the file is downloaded and once the download completes you can de compress it using the operating system compression software or in the command line by copying the command under the URL in the download page the tar zxbf command will uncompress your files just make sure that you type the right file name on these commands to be the compressed once the compressed there will be a folder with all the files that grafana needs to work so to start grafana just go inside of that grafana folder that you just decompressed once inside of the grafana folder you will find multiples of folders on which there's one called ban access the ban folder once inside it you can just run a simple command to start grafana if you are in Windows you can just type grafana space s but if you are on Mac OS you can type instead do/ grafana space server and on Linux distribution just type do/ grafana Das server if something is needed you may add sud sudo at the beginning after you type the commands hit enter and gener you will see a bunch of test scrolling with that grafana will start now open a browser go to Local Host 3000 and you will find grafana ready type admin in user and password to start start playing with grafana running from binaries as you can see there are multiple ways in which you can get grafana up and running in all of your operating systems but once you have graphine installed you may be wondering hm what next well you could check these started videos giving you the first steps and if you want to create visualizations check these super cool panels to use at Max your new grafana happy dashboarding and have a good one
