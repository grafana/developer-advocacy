Transcript: Hello, I'm Mat Ryer from Grafana Labs and I'm
excited to share with you a new way to work with your trace data in
Tempo with Explore Traces. Insights from your traces are
automatically surfaced and, with a point-and-click interface,
you can drill into what's important. The Compare tools let you see
what's unique about errors, so you can narrow it down, drill in, and
solve problems faster than ever before. Let's check out Explore
Traces. To get started, you select one of the RED method
metrics - rate, errors, or duration. The tabs below update
to match that context, bringing proactive visualizations and
other tools to help you investigate further. If we select
Errors as the RED metric, we get the Comparison tab. This surfaces attributes that occur more
in error spans compared to the happy ones. So this makes it easy to spot what's
unique about errors and therefore where they're coming from. Adding clues to the filters
focuses the app on that area. So when you go to the
Root cause errors tab, you're presented with an
aggregation of these error spans, and then with one click, you can see in detail the trace and
easily find out how much time is spent where. If we select
Duration as the red metric, we can use the Comparison tab to
compare slow traces with fast ones, so you can discover attributes that
are more common in slower traces. Jumping to the Slow traces tab shows
you the spans ordered by duration, so you can select the slowest, and
from there you get the entire trace. So that's Explore Traces. Insights from your trace data are
automatically visualized in a beautiful Grafana way. Easily click in
and drill down to learn more. You got the Comparison view, which really tells you where the errors
are coming from and the full trace in detail so you have a full
understanding of your system. The team are working hard on this product
and we'd love your feedback to help guide it. Please get in touch, use the link in the app and also check
out the other Explore apps posted alongside this video. Thanks for watching.
