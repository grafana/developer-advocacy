Transcript: [Music] hey everyone my name is Ryan Perry I'm a principal product manager here at Graff lab specifically for the pyroscope team I'm at the ask the experts Booth here at graphicon and uh yeah we have a question today that I'm going to uh answer for you guys uh this question comes from Ilia mov sorry if I pronounced your name wrong um it says I've provision pyroscope OSS every everything seems fine is there a way to install pyroscope UI to get more enhanced views or is that UI part of pyroscope cloud and so I'm going to answer that question today um so yeah we have multiple different ways where you can uh view your pyroscope data uh this was one of the big benefits of us joining the grafana team and the first one that is available totally open source is the explore Tab and so that's this one um you just go to the go to explore here and you can find your services uh you can select the various different profile types and so that that's what you can find in the explore tab at the same time we do have a separate UI that is available in pyroscope Cloud it offers a little bit additional functionality the ability to um kind of compare and contrast different uh different profile types uh in this case I can select these different labels and I can see how they compare to each other or I can even do a diff between uh maybe one label and another label um in this case I can compare the AP South label to the EU North label and I can get this diff flame graph that tells me what the difference is and so while this UI is only available in pyroscope Cloud right now um this UI is also available uh in your local instance if you go to local 4040 um you'll see something very similar to this that um does all the diff functionality and everything it's just not specifically in your graffan instance yet um but as we announced here at graphicon with the Explorer log app and the Explorer met app um eventually this um you know explore profiles app will be available in both open source and the cloud as well uh so that's all I have for you today uh thanks for taking the time to listen [Music]
