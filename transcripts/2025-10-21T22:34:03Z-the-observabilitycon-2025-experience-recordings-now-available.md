Hello everyone, 

My name is Raj. I'm one of the co-founders and the CEO of Grafana Labs. It's my great pleasure to welcome you to Observability Con 2025 here in London.

We've set up demo stations out there, so please feel free to **ask the experts**. These are the people building these tools, and they are here to help you, so don’t hesitate to go and ask them.

From the very beginning, we have been focused on making hard things simpler, and we are proud of it. We take pride in creating the best open observability tools on the planet.

You all know your observability costs, and the volume of telemetry has been rising exponentially. We are one of the few, if not the only, observability companies that really prioritize this.

Make sure to check out the Grafana Assistant Lab. You can't miss it—there are people there ready to assist you. You can go and play with it and try out the assistant; I think you're going to be impressed. The AI assistant and everything in the labs are available for you to explore. Also, I really enjoyed the presentations yesterday about it; that was my favorite part, I think.
