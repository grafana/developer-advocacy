Transcript: Hi everyone. I'm Nicole van der Hoeven. I'm a senior developer
advocate at Grafana Labs, and I'm here today with two coworkers.  Salud! Well done on that
one. Hi. I am Mihaela Maior. I'm a director of
engineering at Grafana Labs. And we also have Carl with us. Hello. Hi, I'm feeling well.
My name is Carl Berquist, I'm a principal engineer
in the Grafana department. And as of recently, I'm based in Sweden. Awesome. So we're here today to talk
about GrafanaCON. What is GrafanaCON, Mihaela? So, GrafanaCON is our community-focused
conference. We do this every year. We like to make a big bang and hopefully
announce some very exciting, you know, Grafana and open source project
related, but ultimately, it's a community conference focused
on our community where we invite everyone to come, break
bread, share ideas, you know, and learn from each other, teach us what the community
is excited about and all that. And so I'm actually really excited about
it because it will be my first time and it's going to be on April
9th to 10th in Amsterdam. So I actually live in the Netherlands, so this is really a
great opportunity for me. But tell me about it
because I, I've never been. What's so cool about this conference?
Maybe let's, let's do Carl. So this time we're changing
it up a little bit. So instead of just talking
about Grafana, the project, we thought we'd wanna talk about
the whole ecosystem and especially, our other internal projects
that we have: Mimir, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope, and so on. But also
any other project in the open source, monitoring world so that's a big world. And as part of
Grafana strategy and culture, we wanna have a big tent. So, anything
in the open source monitoring world, I hope to see you there and let's
build a strong community together and a better community and better software. I wanna add on top of that, actually, this is the first time we're coming
together in person in five years. So this is a big deal for us. Like
obviously we've collaborated online, we're a remote company, but it's a very special event
when we actually come together. And not just as Grafanistas
but with our community as well. So us coming together in large
numbers in Amsterdam is very exciting. Amsterdam's a beautiful city. I'm really looking forward to
seeing everyone there. And Mihaela, I know that there are also these things
called Golden Grot Awards. What is that? And who is Grot? So Grot is our mascot, I'm
pretty sure it started as a joke. But he became our mascot now
and we have swag with him and also trophies now. So the Golden Grot Awards are
our way to recognize a very interesting usage of our dashboarding
capabilities through Grafana. So we have two categories. There's a
professional one and a personal one. And the criteria is very much make
them exciting and/or valuable. So, if you do them for work, there's a focus on what data
sources you're using or the value you're bringing to your company. But also we're interested in your
personal ones. So that's another category, which is your exciting pet projects, whether you're monitoring your plant or
your sleep and you're doing something funky with it. Or you're helping Japan land on the moon,
you know, things like that. . Yeah, I also realized, I I actually have a nice little Grot
here that I can show you. Wow. Yeah. That we've got .
Yeah, that's awesome. So what are the judges looking for? I
mean, obviously having a dashboard that's, that's a very visual and subjective thing. So what are the specific
things that judges might be
looking at to see which one gets the award? So they would be looking at different
criteria for the two categories that we have. So for the professional one, we'd be interested in the
blast radius in the business, so the value delivery here,
and also the targeted audience. So the outcomes from this and
the type of data you are bringing together to ask and to answer
this data analytics question. Basically on a personal side,
we're looking for unique projects. Something that has emotional
value to our community. I guess something that triggers
strong feelings, hopefully excitement, how cool they are, how fun they are, but also how applicable they might be
for other community members. Like I said, the point of this conference is for us
to come together and share among the community and the Golden Grot is
a way for us to do that as well. It always amazes us how people
use Grafana in ways we didn't predict before. And I think the personal
one is probably the most exciting one. So we have seen beekeepers who wanna
measure the weight of their beehives. We have seen the Grafana
being used in rocket launches, in submarine missions where they
put down pods into the seawater to share internet in the Caribbean. There's
so many different use cases of Grafana. And while some are commercial
and friendly, a lot of
them are personal and very, very interesting to see
and learn more about. It's all about democratizing metrics, regardless if it's
professional or personal. And we're always excited
about seeing that. How many winners are there going to be? There's gonna be two winners,
one for each category. And what will they receive? Oh, so this is actually very exciting.
I was surprised last year, you know, at our small scale in-person
event, to see this. But if you win, you get to join us for the
conference, all expenses paid, you get presented on stage
with an awesome Grot trophy and you're just part of the entire conference
experience. So it's actually a lot, I wish I could could apply. . Oh wow. I wanna see
your dashboard later, . So let's talk about the actual talks.
The CFP is open, the call for papers. You two are both judges along with
others. How many judges are there? 14 Judges in total. Okay. And what are you all looking for? Give us some inside scoop for what
you want to see that would make you go like, "Oh yes, definitely. Yes. ". I think where I get most excited is
when different projects can interact with each other. So when multiple
projects can naturally form a bond and get better together, if that is data sources that
we haven't talked about before, or if that is a certain
metric collector that displays data and my things in ways
we haven't thought about before, that makes me happy. Like whenever these silos of
knowledge start interacting with each other and together , can
form a better view of something, that makes me happy. What about you Mihaela? I really like the funky ones. You
know, when someone comes in, shows us, like I was saying, them monitoring the humidity around their
plants or doing something interesting with their sourdough starters, I feel like that's very special and it's
such a unique way to use the tool that could be classed as a professional
tool. But on top of that, I'm most excited about people getting
a chance to present something they're passionate about, but they're
not necessarily classed
as professionals in it, so anyone that will come and share
with us what they're using in terms of the open source projects
for their particular use case, whether personal or professional, it will be appreciated by the
community and the judges as well. I'd say that this is a
technical conference, but I also welcome submissions that are
a little bit on the non-technical aspect as well. So how did you change
the culture at your company? And if metrics and
monitoring was part of that, I'd be very happy to hear more about that
because that's the experience we wanna bring. It's actually not just the tools, even though these also are great and fun. We wanna make sure that
organizations and people make better decisions by
looking at monitoring data. And that is a lot of our culture as well. Or even visualization, right?
Like having the data is one thing, but what did you actually do with it? How did you actually change things with
it and make decisions that maybe you might not otherwise
have been able to make? Is there a scorecard or
something for the applications? Because I imagine we would get a lot and
it might be really difficult to narrow that down. We have a scorecard, I'm not sure if we wanna talk
about the different categories yet. I'm not sure we locked
them down either,100%. But we'll score submissions
into different categories. And then when we look at aggregate, we'll pick the talks that
we scored the highest. And I'm also thrilled for this conference. I was gonna add on top
of that. While yeah, we're not gonna share the specific
factors that are counted here, what's important is exactly
what we were saying earlier. We want to bring some
value to the community. So this is something very important in
our scoring. You know, we are here to share some knowledge, to get conversation
going, learn from each other. So this is part of what's
important for us. Equally, we've discussed a lot about our
expectations of the presentation itself, and we want to be quite flexible
to new presenters as well. So we're intentionally not
focusing so much on your capabilities to present. It's more about your passion
for what you are presenting. Yeah, I think presenting is,
it sounds like such a big term. Like it makes it feel like, "No, you have to have done this before
and you have to have slides and really something that's very
practiced." We're not performers, we're not actors. You know, if you use Grafana's stuff or one
of the open source projects and even anything in the cloud space, it
sounds like cloud and monitoring. Um, I think if you have a
story, we wanna hear it. Exactly. Yep. And we have different lengths as well. So it doesn't have to be a forty-five
minute deep dive into a topic. It could be a lightning talk
about something you wanna share. Ooh, that would be cool. 'cause
that's, that's a lot easier, you know, so what's a lightning talk?
What's the length on that? So we've not nailed down absolutely
all of the details for the conference, but I'm pretty sure it's about 15
minutes long and we're gonna sprinkle different lengths of sessions,
depending on the topic. I think we're also saying that if you
feel like you're at all interested in sharing your story, don't worry about
being a speaker or not a speaker. You know, we'll help you through
it. You can do a shorter talk, you can do a different format. And
this is, if you are a new speaker, this is a great conference to
start with public speaking. And the three of us are going
to be there to support you. And if you get selected,
what can they actually get? Well, the answer is they get to
join us for GrafanaCON in person. So you get to be part of the experience,
be part of the group of speakers, and connect with like-minded individuals. Yeah, the community
aspect of it is, I think, gonna be one of the best parts
of it. Even if you can't come, if you don't speak at GrafanaCON, come anyway and join us and talk to us. Any last minute tips for
any speakers out there? Well, my tip is go and apply.
Don't wait for the last day please. Because that makes our job harder
in terms of judging and the amount, the numbers of CFPs in the last
minute. But don't overthink it. Come and apply. If you need
support, do reach out. Like I said, this is a community conference,
so let's help each other out. You know, and don't put too much
pressure on yourself. Like we said, we're very open to first-time speakers. This is a conference for
developers by developers. So take from that what you will. And if you're not accepted as a speaker, there's still gonna be a great hallway
track slash "unconference" experience. We definitely wanna bring a lot of
smaller projects together because for many of the small projects, this might be the only conference
they can attend to meet others, and we want to cater to that. So we wanna make sure that everyone can
have their mini experience at GrafanaCON as well. Okay, great. Thank you both for, for coming and sharing with us why
GrafanaCON is such an awesome place to go. We hope that we will see you there
and course it is gonna be a beautiful, beautiful city, a beautiful place and venue in
Amsterdam at the Muziekgebouw. See you there. Bye.
