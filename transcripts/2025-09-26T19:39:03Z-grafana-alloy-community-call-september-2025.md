## Summary

In the September Grafana Community Call, participants, including Kyle and Paul, discussed the upcoming release candidate for version 1.11 of Grafana Alloy, which was cut earlier that day and expected to be officially released soon. The meeting opened with a call for questions, but none were raised. Key topics included significant updates to Prometheus dependencies, including upgrades to remote write V2 that promise up to 60% network savings at the cost of increased CPU and memory usage. They also touched on enhancements in the Windows installer and updates to database observability components for MySQL and PostgreSQL. The discussion highlighted ongoing improvements to the remote write components and the future integration of profile support in OpenTelemetry components. The call concluded with an invitation for community members to engage in discussions around feature proposals and multi-tenancy approaches.

# September Grafana Community Call Transcript

Oh, thank you, Kyle. 

Welcome to the September Grafana Community or Grafana Alloy community call. We don’t have a strict agenda for today, so I’m going to open the floor in a moment to any questions from our community members who are here. Otherwise, we’ll probably discuss a little bit about the upcoming 1.11 release candidate, which was cut earlier today, with the full official release most likely in a couple of days.

Before we do anything, I'll open up for a moment to see if anybody has any questions. I’ll confirm that nobody posted anything in Slack... I don't see anything specifically raised in Slack for the meeting.

Before we started recording, Paul, you were beginning to talk about the 1.11 release. Do you want to start that discussion?

### Discussion on 1.11 Release

**Paul:** Yeah, I was just browsing through the change log to see what went in. There are quite a lot of changes. There are some big upgrades to Prometheus dependencies, OpenTelemetry dependencies, and also smaller but still useful changes, like the fact that the Windows installer is signed, so you won’t get an annoying popup when installing.

As Paul mentioned, the Prometheus components within Alloy have been updated from version 2 to version 3. This brings in support for some things that, within Grafana Cloud, are not yet fully supported, like UTF-8 labels. It also adds Prometheus remote write V2 support. Internally, we're seeing a 50 to 60% network savings on many of our workloads from switching to V2. There’s some extra cost on CPU and memory, but we're seeing network savings that are helpful from a cost perspective. We can discuss remote write V2 a little more later in the meeting if we’d like.

Additionally, there's a significant upgrade to OpenTelemetry dependencies. We were a few releases behind. The Windows Exporter has been updated again as it continues to be modernized and refactored. 

I'm trying to look through the change log to see anything else interesting. If you're leveraging any database observability components, either within Grafana Cloud’s database observability or just using the components without the Grafana Cloud dependency (which would require building your own dashboards, alerts, etc.), those have been updated for MySQL and PostgreSQL, along with many bug fixes and small enhancements.

If anybody has thoughts or questions, feel free to hit the raise hand button, and I'll pause at any point.

**Kyle:** I just wanted to call out that on top of adding remote write V2 support for Wall Q and the remote write component, there are a couple of fixes in this release for the remote write component that should hopefully lead to less resource utilization as well.

### Remote Write V2 Overview

**Paul:** I can briefly talk about the remote write V2. The protocol essentially includes a compression algorithm. Instead of having all your string labels throughout your data, samples, metadata, etc., there’s a symbol list at the top of the request. All the data is essentially deduplicated, and where you would have had a string label, you now have an index reference to that list. This is where you get a lot of the network savings from. However, the way the various write-ahead log (WAL) implementations work means there's extra processing required before you can send the message, which is where that extra CPU and memory cost comes from. 

We’re looking into various ways to continue optimizing that. For now, there’s about a 10% extra cost, but that varies depending on your workload and other factors. Internally, we’re experiencing those improvements. 

I've seen improvements to the Pyroscope components, which made me think that in the coming months, we’ll probably see support for profiles in OpenTelemetry components. We haven’t prioritized anything yet, but sooner or later, there will definitely be auto-native components that also support profiles. 

I suppose we’ll have to create hotel-native equivalents for the things that Pyroscope-specific components are doing right now. I haven’t checked with the Pyroscope team, but I think there will be more soon regarding the coexistence of Pyroscope and OpenTelemetry, as the upstream collector already has support for profiles in some components. 

### Open Floor for Questions

I didn’t have any other topics planned to bring up in lieu of any Q&A, so I’ll open the floor again if anyone else has topics they’d like to discuss or questions they have.

One thing we’ve considered doing more in the community call is having a proposal review meeting for the public Alloy proposals board. Here, we consider GitHub issues proposed by community members for new features or behaviors within Alloy. Right now, there’s not a whole lot that’s very interesting in the active or likely to be accepted or declined state. There is one about supporting the Prometheus push gateway that might be interesting. These are often in states where, if there are interested community members who'd like to contribute, these are interesting places to start.

We’re also looking into investigating a more standardized multi-tenancy approach in the next quarter. We’ve seen a lot of GitHub issues and comments from community members around multi-tenancy in Alloy and how it’s supported or not supported across the different ecosystems we support. 

If you have any interest in those conversations, please jump into those issues on the Alloy proposals board.

### Closing Remarks

I see Matt asked about Prometheus remote write V2. Matt, I’m not sure if you just joined or if you had to split your focus, but we discussed that earlier on the call. The next release, v1.11, which had its release candidate come out today, will likely have the full release within the next few days or early next week. It supports remote write V2 in both the Prometheus remote write component, which is based on the upstream Prometheus WAL and remote write, and the experimental Prometheus write Q, based on the WAL Q implementation that started in Grafana.

Both of those support remote write V2. Internally, we’ve seen about a 50 to 60% network savings at the cost of about 10% CPU and memory. That will vary depending on workload and environment, but we’re seeing significant network savings as expected. 

You do need to use the experimental components for this feature. It’s still experimental in both components, so just a callout there.

**Paul:** I think the Prometheus write Q component is experimental itself as well. In the coming months, it will gradually become more stable. There will be more code improvements, documentation improvements, and hopefully more people will start using Prometheus write Q as opposed to the remote write. It has some benefits, but it just needs some polishing.

I’ll leave another minute here for any last comments. Otherwise, we’ll wrap up relatively early.

Thank you, everybody, for coming and participating. We’ll see you next month!

## Raw YouTube Transcript

Oh, thank you, Kyle. All right, so welcome to the September Graphana community or Grafana alloy community call. Um, we don't have a strict agenda for today. So, I'm gonna open the floor in a moment to any questions from our community members who are here. Um, otherwise we'll probably discuss a little bit of the upcoming 1.11 release candidate was cut earlier today with the full official release most likely uh in a couple of days. So before we do anything, we'll open up for a moment if anybody has any questions and I'll confirm that nobody posted any Slack. All right. I don't see anything uh that was raised specifically in Slack for the meeting. Um so before we started recording, Paul, you were starting to talk about the 1.11 release. Do you want to start that discussion? Uh yeah, I was just browsing through the change log just to see what went in. There are quite a lot of changes. There are some big upgrades to Prometheus dependencies, open telemetry dependencies, and also um smaller but still useful things like the fact that the Windows installer is signed so you wouldn't get an annoying popup if uh you're installing. Yeah, as Paul mentioned, um the Prometheus dependency, so all the Prometheus components within alloy have been updated from a version two path to version three. Um this brings in support for some things that uh within Graphana Cloud are not yet fully supported like UTF8 labels um but also adds Prometheus remote write V2 support. Um, internally we're seeing um a 50 to 60% network savings on a lot of our workloads from switching to V2. There's some extra cost on CPU and memory. Um, but internally we're seeing some uh some savings on on network that's helpful from a cost perspective. Um, could discuss uh remote write v2 a little more further on in the meeting uh if we'd like. Also a big upgrade as was mentioned to hotel dependencies. We were a few releases behind. Uh the Windows Exporter has been updated again as that continues to upstream be modernized and refactored. Trying to look through the the change log as well to see anything else interesting. Um if you're leveraging any database observability components either within Grafana Cloud's database observability or you can just you know use the components without the Grafana cloud dependency. You just then have to build your own dashboards, alerts, etc. around it. Those have been updated for my SQL and and Postgress and a lot of a lot of bug fixes and and small enhancements here or there. If you have any if anybody has any thoughts or or questions, feel free to just hit the raise hand button and I'll I'll pause at any point. Looks like Kyle, you unmuted. I'm not sure if you had a topic you wanted to contribute to. Oh, I just also wanted to call out uh on top of adding like remote write v2 support for wall Q and the remote write component, there's a couple of fixes in in this release for the remote right component that should hopefully lead to uh less resource utilization um as well. Cool. Um I can talk briefly about the the remote write v2. Um the protocol is essentially um a compression algorithm in the protocol. Um so rather than having all of your your string labels um throughout your your data, your samples, your metadata, etc., there's kind of a symbol list at the top of the the request. Um and then all of the data is basically dduplicated everywhere else where you would have had a string label. you just have an index reference to that list. So that's where you get a lot of the network savings from. But the the way the various write ahead log wall implementations work means there's extra processing required before you can send the message which is where that extra CPU and memory cost comes from. We're looking into various ways to continue optimizing that. for now at least there's a I think it's 10 10ish% uh extra cost there but that depends on on your workload and and various other things but that's what we're internally experiencing by the way I see uh improvements to the Pyroscope components which is But it also made me uh think that in the coming months we'll probably see support for profiles in open telemetry components. Um we haven't prioritized anything yet, but sooner or later there there definitely will be auto native components in that also support profiles. And I suppose we'll have to make um um hotel native equivalents for the kind of thing that Pcope specific components are doing right now. But I haven't checked with the Paris scope team. But I think there will be more soon in the realm of um and Proscope coexisting together because the upstream collector already has support for profiles um in some components. Just a matter of time until we have as well. I think it might be happening more or less around the time when Graphana cloud also has a profile um support for the auto gateway because at the moment I don't think there is I think right now there's logs metrics and traces not sure about profiles probably it isn't I didn't have any other topics um that I was planning to bring up um in lie of any any Q&A. Um, so open the floor again if anyone else has any other topics they'd like to discuss or questions they have. One thing that we have thought about doing more in the community call internally, we have a proposal review meeting for the the public alloy proposals board um where we consider uh GitHub issues that are either proposed by community members or others uh for for new features or new behavior within Alloy. Um, right now there's not a whole lot in there that's that's very interesting that in the active or or likely to be accepted or declined state. Um, there's one about supporting Prometheus push gateway that uh might be interesting and these are often in states where if there are interested community members who'd like to contribute, these are an interesting place to start. We're also looking to this next quarter um investigate kind of a more standardized multi-tenency approach. We've seen a lot of um a lot of GitHub issues and comments from community members around multi-tenency in alloy and the way it's supported or not supported in the different ecosystems that we support. So um if you have any interest in those conversations um please jump in to those issues there on the alli proposals board. Um I see Matt um asked about Prometheus remote right v2. Um Matt I'm not sure uh if you just joined or if you've uh had to uh split your focus but we discussed that earlier on the call. So this next release um v1.11 that the release candidate came out today and the full release likely within the next few days early next week does support remote write v2 in both the Prometheus remote write component which is based off of the upstream Prometheus uh wall and remote write and the experimental Prometheus write Q which is based on the the wall Q implementation that started in graphana. Both of those support remote write V2. Um, I have the numbers for wall Q because that's what we use internally. Um, in our workloads, we've seen about a 50 to 60% network savings at a cost of 10%ish CPU and memory. Um, so that'll vary depending on workload and environment. Um, but we're we're seeing some pretty significant network savings like we expected from that. So that's um that's internally we're rolling it out um throughout our our various uses of of alloy to get those uh those savings for you know network ingress egress costs. So it you do need to use experiment to hold it. It's experimental in both components essentially just also as a call out. Thanks for clarifying that Kyle. Go ahead Paul. Um I think the uh Prometheus right Q component is experimental itself as well. Uh so in the coming months it will gradually become more and more stable. Um so there will be more uh happening in that space. Um yeah there will be some code improvements. documentation improvements and hopefully more and more people will start using Prometheus right Q as opposed to the remote right. It does have some benefits but it just needs some polishing. Leave another another minute up here for any last comments. Otherwise, we'll wrap up relatively early. Okay, thanks everybody for coming and participating and uh yeah, we'll see you next month.
