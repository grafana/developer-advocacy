Transcript: okay we are live nice thank you everyone hello yeah yeah yeah welcome everyone we found a campfire we're back no this is exciting yeah 10 minutes late i mean yeah we're talking about conferences right so do they start on time you really try to yeah actually sometimes you you you're tempted to kind of get going early like if if things have gone so well and everyone's sat down and you're waiting but then it's not really fair if people are going to just be turning up for a specific thing so so that's when usually I have to go around and and fill and just make something up and talk to people which is very fun uh and this is what happens at Graphfonicon this is what happened last time a few times and uh they're my favorite bits it's very I'm very nervous about it but it's it's like a positive nervous energy you know so you're you're you're going to host this year again right yes so it couldn't have been that bad right i'm back yeah um maybe we can introduce oursel a bit for the for those who are joining first time this live stream yeah I'd love to do that um this is Carl this is Carl how about I introduce you Carl make up some facts so yeah I'm Matt Royer um I'm a senior principal engineer Graphfana Labs and also a host of uh well this uh do the Big Tent podcast and Graphfana and Grafana's different to the rest because I have to wear trousers i'm there in real life basically and is literally one of the rules carl yeah so my name is Carl Befist i'm also a senior principal engineer i'm not a host at Grafana but I'm one of the co-chairs so I get to do a lot of the mangling and decisions for what we're going to speak about at Grafana um I don't consider like wearing trousers a big problem aton i I tend to do that whenever I go around my house as well david you want to say something yeah yeah i run I run the Graphana team uh so I work with Matt and Carl and yeah also been to a few Graphana cons um also not having a problem with trousers usually yeah no that works um yeah and uh Osman do you want to introduce yourself real quick yeah my name is Yeah my name is Usman i am a senior developer advocate and I'm going very first time at Grafana and I'm also doing a workshop there so I'm super excited and I'm very nervous as well so this year will be amazing i missed the last year in Amsterdam it was pretty cool but uh this year I'm all eyes and ears and probably meet some of you there as well nice what's your workshop what's the workshop you doing oh I am doing a workshop which I will also explain a bit in detail but it's all about learning and crafting your art how to do amazing visualizations using graphana oh great I I'd love to go to that but not might not be able to oh yeah we we are pretty packed up yeah is do you have to wear trousers in it oh yeah the that's the requirement you have to wear trousers yeah fair enough okay we're going to have workshops on day zero right so you should be able to attend it but more on that later I guess so do you want to pick the next topic sorry for interrupting yeah no no no all good so yeah uh I think we have some amazing topic lined up for today and I think I will uh uh start first uh what is Grafanocon and I think none other than Matt Ryer can explain us what is Grafanocon because he's a pro at Grafana so Matt please explain us what is Grafana well it's a place and a time where we get together in real life which is unusual in tech but we do it still and we just get to kind of hear about all the stuff that's been going on across Graphana and because because of the size now of the company like it's unbelievable how much stuff there is going on um I think tickets are still available uh so if you if you want to come along do uh it's going to be in Seattle right in early May we can put some more details on that later but you get to interact with uh experts you get to like meet the people building the tools that you're using so you know it's it's a great way to not only learn about what's happening but really influence what happens we take a lot of that input uh that we learn at conferences like in our internal Slack it get we we share a lot of quotes around like ah someone just said this about this particular thing and this is a great idea or this is something we need to consider or need to balance with other things and I think it that that is really nice for us to kind of interact and and meet people um to help us make sure we are building things that people need and building things that people get delighted by and it's primarily open- source uh stuff because of course Grafana Labs has uh paid offerings and things but we focus on open source don't we at Grafana Lab at Grafana you mentioned uh there's going to be expert there's going to be experts Are you one of the experts Matt uh I suppose so but um am I no I I try not to I'm I host it so normally I'm quite busy doing that um if I'm not on stage introducing talks I'm usually offstage worrying about the next time I have to go on stage to introduce a talk and figure out how what am I going to say that isn't going to be horrible you know uh and but but I but I also do get to chat i mean because I build things as well at Grafana Labs so um yeah I get that same benefit chatting to people and hearing those d ideas and feedback directly um but I I don't know do you call yourself an expert i don't so we we we have this ask the ask the expert booth right and uh uh everyone from Grafana Labs who joins usually also has to just men or like be a person on that booth for a while and so I'm I'm also signed up and I'm guessing Carl you're signed up as well there while you're there right and so yeah if anyone who's uh joining the conference has any questions like that's the place to go and then yeah maybe your issue ends up on our road map right like that's how this works this year we also have uh some of our maintainers for various different projects showing up early to graphicon so if you want to meet them in a smaller crowd and have longer conversation you can attend the birth of feder sessions so there's both the ask expert during the whole days like find people on all of our products and topics and also bal feeders to connect to all the experts of different various skill sets so we that that's the experience we really want to cater for and optimize for like not just seeing presentation but engaging as well what's a what's a what's a bird and a feather what's that yeah so so so oh I'm not sure that's the actual best description of these sessions but that's what we call them uh if I'm going to be blunt and honest uh but the the idea is that we're going to have mainteners in those in certain dedicated rooms for all our projects and you can have longer conversations with them but the the downside of ask boat is that they they get swarmed during breaks so if you want to have a a little bit of a longer conversation or a topic that is just not something that you can quick get a quick answer to then you should probably go to the birth of obser sessions instead and and since it's in the morning uh pros and cons with that but there's probably going to be less people talking to than maintainers during that time that's a good tip it's tough because you don't want to miss you don't want to miss any talks they're before the talks they're the talks but I mean like throughout the day it sometimes can nip out as well and I like the fact that there's such a kind of wide range of topics so that you can select like which one's going to be most impact for you most useful actually I like the talks that have the the real actionable stuff this is the thing that I hear a lot they'll say you know because it's nice to sit and just look at cool stuff that's happening and see if software evolving and see where things are going but when you see people say "Right that thing we can use that tomorrow i'm going to take that back to the team now." You know um I that's where I get really excited and I feel like that you've really got some value now from this so uh and that and that I hear that a lot more than most other conferences and I think that's probably just because uh a lot of people that come to Grafana really are using Graphfana tech open source or paid and yeah they get a lot out of it so um I yeah I hope hope to see more of that as well this year and I know we will based on the schedule yeah and I think one one one key point here is also is that not only it's just all about like attending sessions or workshop it's also a great opportunity to meet us and also some of the open source community contributors uh we have some passionate uh uh open source community users uh who are very active on our community forums and slack and they will be there as well so um it's a good way to maybe someone is your superstar who solves a lot of your problem you can just say hi and connect with that person so uh yeah uh I I will definitely try to meet some of those uh folks from the open source community and also some of the graphinista as well because there's these are the events which uh uh which is the moment where you can meet someone face to face in person yeah I know and that is after after COVID that was um I mean really in COVID we we missed that for sure and you know Grafana Labs is a completely remote company so it's 100% remote everyone kind of works at home and we're spread across the globe um so it's extra special when we get together and have those face-toface interactions and yeah that extends to whoever gets to come to those conferences too but I'm I'm kind of wondering was it always like this because this isn't also the first Grafana now right like we've done this last year um before that I think was COVID and then we we ran a few before that um when was the first one yeah when was the first one 2015 we did um it was more like a meetup half day meetup but we call it Grafana because you gota you gota have marketing do dream big yeah so that was at the Squarespace office in New York um Oh wow so that that that was our first experience i still have stickers from that conference on my on my laptop very proud of them uh after that we did Graphfana Con 2016 also in New York and we did that at the aircraft hanger which was a very special feeling to being at the museum and that kind of atmosphere of being in the may like their their big theater doing the keynotes and so on um we we actually researched doing that again but prices has apparently skyrocketed for interrupted but that was a very unique feeling then we had a break during 17 and 2018 we went to Amsterdam and this was still at the time where we could fit the whole company on stage right and that's when David joined on stage or joined Graphana Labs on stage i've heard about this david tell us more yeah no yeah it's it's uh so first of all I was upset that this was the Grafana that wasn't on the Intrepid um because I I only found out afterwards that there was one on on this aircraft carrier that also had a space shuttle on it and like that just all sounded so cool and then we were in Amsterdam and I was uh I was invited i was I was a guest at that point and uh it was it was sort of minus 10Â° all these little canals were frozen and uh but I someone in the marketing department was really clever because they actually uh came up with a swag item and it was a scarf that had like a long sort of uh sort of u metrics chart on it and that obviously was a super hit because it was it was freezing like people were on the canals like they were just frozen over uh that was absolutely wild yeah wow did the Did the Did the graphs update on the scarf or were they just static like they really should have yeah they really should have but so the the the good thing was also they were very visible because they were sort of pink purple so like a really nice uh really nice cover i like I wish I I wish I'd had gotten one but no I was uh No I didn't no I I still don't no I was I was invited because uh that that was when it was decided that uh Tom and I Tom the CTO and I are are joining the company and so uh I was also on stage then as sort of a future employee and that was exciting yeah that was around the time when like Prometheus really took off and we wanted to invest more also in the Prometheus ecosystem yeah and that was that was also a beautiful venue like that that that little house in in Amsterdam yeah 2019 in LA that was when really Prometheus was a very big thing for Grafunnel Labs and we started having like a cloud native observability track instead of the more like it classic IT ops graphite based uh monitoring so it really kicked off around that time and that was uh 2019 was our last graphicon before COVID hit uh we so we did some virtual ones but honestly when I put together a list of graphicons I I didn't include them because uh while they were good at that time I I I feel like it's a very different thing compared to the inerson ones yeah I remember sorry sorry if I or Matt you want to go first i was just going to say it's definitely better not not having a global pandemic yeah no this the one the one the one 2019 was also the one in LA was really the last one where the Gfanicon itself doubled as our own all hands uh that's just that just wasn't possible afterwards yeah yeah after that conference we got on a one bus to to Vegas like the company went into one bus there's no way we could do that post cor it's risky it is i mean we can but we'll be not idle yeah but that's where all the aliens are isn't it we go on that drive Route 66 that way isn't it it's that it's in that desert at least so I'm just saying like it's risky because if they all everyone just got abducted like if some people just get abducted it's okay we can deal with that they talk about the bus factor but this is this is the the terrible factor yeah it is the the worst possible bus factor everyone on the bus yeah yeah no and then and then co right and then Amsterdam right how was Amsterdam again um what do you say Matt how do what's your thought about Amsterdam well I thought it was phenomenal um the venue was it was like this theater that was just enormous and it was packed um um and then yeah just I think I I think they're really they have such a fun uh tone to them a fun kind of atmosphere um so we have a lot of fun at the same time and then then you have like in these insightful talks and things um you know that you learn all this kind of amazing stuff as well um so yeah I think that that that might be that was like I think the the big one for me that I really enjoyed was that Amsterdam one yeah I think I think that's also Oh no you go ahead yeah but it's it's also slightly different to because we're we're running another conference right called Opscon and and so there is still a difference to going to Grafana then going to Obscon and uh we're we're also obviously in the company trying to figure out well I guess like we we've figured it out but um trying to make it clear what the difference is ultimately and I think that's also one of the community questions right like should I like where should I go do I get the both to both get the same content so we do we do try to have them at different parts of the planet but also at different times of the year right so there is sort So it is still a venue where you can learn what's going on at Kafana Labs but I think there's something you mentioned this earlier Matt like this is where you learn about like the latest stuff and that you can play right away but I think that's that's that's always kind of comes with a caveat that this is Grafana is more the place where we show what we're working on right now like stuff that's really brand new right and that you some of the stuff might be in in preview still and you have to maybe you have to set a feature flag to try it out which is I think the big difference to opscon right like opscon is more here's all the stuff that is already readily available and you could show it to your whole team and uh and sort of more more integrated and also like sort of bigger commercial focus right where graphfana is really more around the open source projects that we have right is that roughly the difference or like how do you perceive this Carl i think that's a good summary uh something else to mention is that Obscon is observability only focused graphana con is observability and other use cases uh so it's really about expanding our open source footprint across the whole world for in so many businesses that we can as possible so there there are they have a little bit of a different target but Yeah and and honestly like we sell all both of them so So people are still eager to hear more about what um what we're doing so it's it's a good problem to have um and we're tweaking on messaging and like um marketing for these events to make it even more clear what what people expect because we want to make sure that people get what they expect when going to these conferences yeah so would you say they get you you can probably have more influence if you go to Grafana since the work is still flux and in progress yeah absolutely yeah 100% yeah so you because there it's also uh where a lot of the plug-in maintainers are hanging out and so if you are also a user of parts that are just happening in the wider ecosystem yeah you might run into someone who's written uh I don't know like the latest BI plugin or or like the reddis data source or something right um yeah I feel like that would happen less at opscon yeah but at OBSCON um we have Yeah the like where was it that we had the the the Japanese space agency came to talk about the that was that was in Amsterdam yeah so I mean that's what I mean like think about that for some content never mind being on the Intrepid the these they they put they put something on the moon and then you know they they showed how they used Graphfana tech to do that um which obviously like you think well I'm probably not going to need that because I'm not popping anything on the moon but uh like the same challenges exist like in lots of different places and a lot of the stuff's transferable so uh I loved that one and there's also a good one Planted uh I remember also being quite quite a good one this this sort of artificial meat um you know company so they're creating meat from plant-based sources plants in other words um yeah so it's just like such a great mix of uh content and and people which is really cool yeah thanks and we I think we get one more question which is also asked very uh uh very frequently like after graphana what is are there are some similar events which follow graphana not we are talking about offscon so I think I get it's more about like graphana on the road or in your in your local uh areas maybe um someone can explain a little bit in more detail what those events are look like yeah so we call them graphana locals uh graphana locals I mean uh which is is a mini conference half a day uh where we uh fly graphanistas to those and reive the keynote uh in various different cities around the world so if you cannot attend Grafana in Seattle and are based in Montreal not Toronto and Mexico City you you can attend Grafana local instead we're also going to Berlin and we are going to Singapore and Bangalore as well so we're trying to reuse the same content and make it available all across the world and not just to people who can travel to Seattle it's it's a slim down version of the experience though but it's still a really good opportunity to meet the the builders and also other people in the community who are using Grafana and various other related technology well slimmed down isn't a bad thing in this case right because you probably have more time with people maybe as well yeah oh I want to go to the Mexico City one i've been to Mexico City a couple of times and I love it it's a great place and the food's amazing is the food good at these conferences Carl i have no idea when Graphana local is new for this year actually so I I don't know but I was kind of hoping it would be good in Mexico City i love tacos so but it's for unfortunately it's not me going to Mexico City right sorry i'm going to be in Berlin that's all right berlin's cool too berlin's cool i don't know about the food though you can get tacos there you can but I I just I just get the Yeah yeah no I've been to a few events in Berlin and uh that are just run by international companies and they they tend to also get catering that tries to just give them the local cuisine and it's and it's it's curry versopped up sausage with a bit of uh curry infused ketchup and I don't know I don't think it's anything to write home about yeah you you you probably say like I have ate enough and I want to try something i know the feeling yeah but a lot of people travel and they've never had chopped up sausage with curry sauce uh yeah yeah there's there's another conference there that I host in Berlin and and they have uh this hummus so I I'll hook you up David there's hummus people dr hummus it is do you know Dr hummus it's not they're not medical cuz I I thought I hurt myself and I went to them and they were like "No actually we this is primarily hummus we we actually don't really know how we don't know how to help you which was a shame but um delicious hummus though so I just had that instead and go to real hospital later no that Yeah it's probably it's probably better but they So I I think curry wors is definitely a local thing um and I think the other big thing is is sort of dun kebab right so like the the Turkish influence that you have in Berlin um which is can also can just be equally greasy as this as the curry burst so yeah I feel like this is after after a long night out in Berlin like those are your choices dr hummus is not going to help you but it's it's curry burst or the donor kebab you need you could do like a hummus pharmacy or something which like halfway you know you could go and just get get a takeaway or something but the question is that if if that is open on the weekends in because that's the other part especially in Germany that's a good question not much happening on a Sunday yeah that is true yeah so uh graphfana con local and so we're going to try a similar thing that we did also with opscon on the road right so because we took the opscon content and also made it available um on sort of other parts of the world right after that conference and so yeah curious how it's going to work out uh next time uh I do wonder though if people would like to attend workshops do we bring this to the local things as well or is this more graphana only yeah uh workshops is graphana only it's it's that's a good question though like maybe we can think about that in the future so also when we compare opscon and graphicon we we always want to experiment more with graphicon and we want to be a little bit more thoughtful about obs uh so we so sometimes at Grafana there's going to be experiment and new ideas for how we can engage with the community they're not always going to be like things we keep uh or perfect but that's just how we want to see this conference evolve we want to take a little bit more risk there which is also more exciting cuz Yeah well honestly at at Graphfana at one of them uh somebody fed me a cupcake just fed it to me and I didn't even use my hand my own hands so you don't get that at every conference and do you know what I mean so what I mean is like it's quite unpredictable it can be um and yeah experimental in some ways uh but hang on though so what's a work what happens in the workshops what is a workshop do you want to cover that Osman i think you had that topic prepared a little bit yeah so uh yeah I I would love to share my screen i am not sure how but I will give a try uh just give me a moment so uh okay I think I got it so I would like to present i like how this says you can see a campfire on the background here where just where our faces are positioned you can see the camp flag and then the word fire which I think it says campfire down there just this is a bit meta i'm just doing some meta fill that's meant to give you some time yeah no I hope you can see my screen in full resolution uh not yet not yet we can if we do that uh maybe we need to change the streamyard layout okay we see it now yeah okay perfect so yeah um this is the link to the graphana if you just even land to the graphana uh uh homepage and I think the link is which I know is here uh I mean if you just click here and yeah so you can do that as well and here is all the agenda the hands-on lab and so on but uh let's talk about the hands-on lab um uh we have actually uh this year plan four amazing labs which are very different from each other so it's your choice what you want to learn or which area you want to pick and build your expertise the first one is uh graphana code which is like build and deploy your dashboard at a scale and uh this is all about learning uh dashboard and how you can do it uh from code uh so this is uh will happen in early morning on Tuesday uh this one is mine i'm very excited about it uh this is about uh learning best practices and uh skills to level up your dashboard skills so basically uh I can talk a little bit on on this but uh in very short uh it's all about that you know how to create a dashboard but you might be missing some of the graphana built-in features and all those uh panel options which may be a bit tricky in the beginning but uh if you if you utilize it you can extend your dashboard uh and make it really dynamic so uh it's also something you want to take a look then the third one we have is uh using uh uh open telemetry and uh prometheus with graphana alloy uh I think there is uh multiple times said that we love open telemetry and uh we we also want to be remain open source and uh vendor free from vendor lock so this is something you can use open telemetry and also learn alloy uh how to use it with graphana and last but not least uh is about uh creating a custom data source so this is something also very popular in the community because a lot of graphana so um I can just take a look here that we have around 150 data source available on graphana catalog so this is our catalog where you can find all the amazing uh plugins uh for different data sources and but you want to build something for private you can uh which you want to keep it internally in your organization but how so this lab explain all these uh uh all that in detail and uh yeah um these are the workshop which you can um definitely check out just click on it get more detail uh and I I think there's a still time we have still some uh space left uh before we run out of it so uh first come first serve kind of thing so yeah uh yeah this is this is great and these to be clear these aren't they're not like just special talks are they this is hands-on you actually get stuck in here oh yeah definitely so uh these are all three hours uh dedicated workshop where you will be not sitting alone there will be graphanistas uh who will help you to learn uh to do all those exercises so it will be intense but in a fun way we we make sure that you don't say it was very intense uh but yeah these are full 3-hour dedicated workshop uh which are all I believe on the on on Tuesday May 6 so yeah uh definitely something you want to check out and man when you say it's intense you don't mean it's in a tent do you you mean it's because it's in an office right or it's in the venue but maybe that's not a bad idea maybe that's not a bad idea though for the old Grafana campfire we could uh could literally pitch some tents that'd be quite fun should we do that that's a unique experience there you go so we we experimental what can I say yeah uh that's a good idea man actually uh we can we can we can say like next year we will do in a tent and see the experience it will be open tent open source and open learning big tent as well oh o this writes itself these workshops is uh is based on feedback that we got last year at Grafana where people wanted more hands-on learnings and uh so we really wanted to do that this year so we agreed on these four topics and this is a good opportunity to become like a master of graphunnel dashboards and also like getting started with data sources and so on so we try to get like have a um have a lot of different levels of uh of these workshops so you can learn as much as possible okay um we we got a question from the community uh so the question is from Suliman will we have a blog post or webinar about this workshop later we don't have technology to be in different workshop at the same time yet yeah we are working on clone technology there was a hackathon project where someone would successfully cloned somebody um but there's a lot of ethical things and you know I don't if you've seen severance um you know there's a lot to think about but but you're right we can't clone yet so do we have a blog post or webinars or anything for the workshops um I can say a little bit from the dev advocacy side so uh the dev advocacy team uh already planning some of uh some content to not to more like a uh learning journey in terms of workshop it obviously we can't do a workshop for 3 hours and uh upload it on on on our docs but we are creating something uh on early journey early user journey experience on the doc site which is more like a workshop but you guide it's like a step-by-step guidance like first do this do that so probably this will happen obviously take some time but we have already started and we have already planned some some of these uh user journey experience uh tutorials so I will I will share the link uh yeah um so that is something probably in the agenda yeah that and that is great but you sort of can't beat that experience of being sat there and actually doing it and then having you know never mind ask the experts hang out with them and tell them tell the experts things yeah but yeah you can't you just can't beat that sort of still we we haven't been able to beat that inerson experience yet I think yeah I was I was going to say sometimes some of these workshops in in the past they also involved sort of physical parts like we had an we had an IoT workshop right with uh sensors and uh and yeah you just sort of sit together and fiddle together and and and try to see uh like yeah like what the room temperature is or or these kinds of things and uh yeah and you've got something to take home which I think was really cool yeah I love that actually anytime technology reaches out into the real world I get excited because we spend so much time virtually you know building things uh yeah you just something special about that I think so there's a few other things that happen during Gfana right so we have the workshops then there's the keynote but then there's also another segment we ran at the previous one called Golden Grotz could you explain what that's about Oman yeah sure and I will need to present my screen again so give me a moment okay so I I prepare some slides for this so I will start with the very very common question which I I think everyone in the community have in mind because uh we do this and the question is like can I win a trip to Grafana well is it is that a common question oh yeah it is because uh in our community Slack which we have on the Grafana champion side we have some champions in the past who who had won this trip so how so the question is how exactly so yes you can and the key to is the golden growth awards so what is golden growth award so we again go to the graphana page and I hope I find the right page yeah so yeah exactly on the graphana page we have a tab for the golden growth awards so basically this is something we uh we did in the past uh where uh you as a participant uh submit your uh dashboards which are either professional or something you created on personal level and submit it and these are the instructions that you submit it we judge it there is a community vote as well so it's not that we are just voting it but it is also comm uh also involvement from the community and then we do the final recognization and then there is a winner and you can find all the detail here on the golden growth page you can register for here well I I'm I'm pretty sure uh you can try for the next year as uh because this year we are already um kind of full or done the deal uh and and I just want to highlight some of the amazing dashboard which we have from the community um so this is already announced on our Graphana community slack in the announcement channel and uh yeah these are the dashboard which we were like finalized or the finalist uh which we will announce the winner who at Grafana in Seattle and you can take a look uh at each of these dashboard you can definitely get some inspiration some ideas of your own like how you can design some amazing dashboard of your own and submit it for the next year Graphana and maybe you are the lucky one uh to win a trip uh to the next year Grafana so yeah uh I think this is an again an exciting uh opportunity for the community because it is also involved uh a vote from the community not from us so it's it goes in both direction so yeah that's very cool and I go back and stop sharing and what what how do you how do you win is is it the the problem that the dashboard kind of addresses is it visually what it looks like what what's the criteria it's just up to the community you're not allowed to submit that it's the community who submit these dashboards [Laughter] yeah no I think I think that's also actually a good question so it actually is both something which you you you define a criteria problem which you were facing and how you solve it from a dashboard uh using graphana or something uh which you you you you have already in existence some other dashboard but you revamp it you modify it make it more make it more cleaner more goodlooking and make the more uh experience more richer so it's kind of a both so uh it's not that uh what we say like uh just create a dashboard and submit well that will be very less effort you have to put some effort to create those dashboard uh goodlooking and dynamic so yeah yeah okay but I mean do we check the identity of the people that submit i'm just trying to I'm just trying to submit trying to win what do you win if you win the award you win a trip to Grafana yeah I think you not only win a trip to Grafana but you also be invited i think last year all the winners from the last Graphfana they like uh like on the stage uh be the get your moment show the world like what you have achieved with Graphfana uh and uh how you help the community by uh showing showcasing your dashboard maybe someone again it's it's all about inspiration all about ideas so uh I think it's it's it's pretty cool to say that you you just not win a trip to Grafanon but meet others meet us uh uh be on a stage and yeah it's it's like a allin-one complete package deal yeah it does sound good I I want to do bit though but I I realize I can't but I want to win all that stuff would you have a good dashboard well yeah we I do have some quite good dashboards um but I don't have any IoT ones and that that is kind of where I would be quite excited but I don't have time uh I just want to you know monitor what makes it what makes a good dashboard Matt uh I I think it I do think it has to look good and with Grafana like you really can like there's a lot of ways you can make it look visually really sort of aesthetically really attractive and I think it's worth it i guess some people just think doesn't matter just show me the data um but you know if you're going to look at it every day we should look good right I agree i I also wanted to like be opinionated about what I actually want to see and not just everything that can possibly be shown um so I I rather see like me having to scroll a little bit if needed instead of just everything at once all right so we got the the talks the keynote the workshops ask the expert booth awards what else can you expect there was something about science yeah lots of science happening there was like a Wasn't there some kind of science roundup science fair science fair what's that about so we're going to showcase uh a bunch of different hackathons and fun ways we have been experimenting with graphana and how you can use graphana for maybe not always super serious um project but you can use graphana in so many different fun ways and we have our hackathon right now it's every four four weeks of hackathon each year and during these hackathons we we do silly stuff uh to push graphana and we want to showcase some of them at Grafana this year yeah but it's so good because you know you have in in Grafana we have these hackathon weeks so you just have a week to do stuff and we really try and build real things uh but but only having a week really forces you to focus on something or uh do something novel that's never been done like there's something about that that unusual time constraint that really helps so that's why I think the science fair projects are uh they're so fun and and have to remember that they were just done in a week is also quite amazing but I think that's good for people to see that you can it doesn't you know it doesn't take long to build these things and try things and experiment and iterate so um yeah that you you can see some real examples of that and plus they are some of them are just great i know that um I remember Sven and Ivana engineers at Grafana Labs uh did a bird tracking uh one where they had microphones outside that would be listening for bird song bird sounds and it would uh classify them using your friend and mine artificial intelligence and then visualize all that so you could see uh you know you can just see what birds are around around you um you know so it's like that's just kind of great that is great have you have you been to Seattle anyone here from what's what's So for anyone who's going what's not to miss in Seattle i think the market everyone says don't miss the marketplace there's a famous market but I'm not 100% sure what this in more detail is about probably like selling stuff it usually but I I went very quickly i was there for for just work so I was in in an office you know in a taxi in the hotel and then home so I didn't really get to see the town but it was very They've got a big mountain there which quite unusual so that's nice and um I I remember there was like a building there was like a car park that just was like slanted so I don't know if I dreamed this it looked like Inception so but I wouldn't miss that again if it's real if I haven't dreamed it you know yeah oh there we go pike Place Public Market yeah this is actually Josiah he's actually one of our Grapana community champions so and he lives in Seattle so he knows all the tips and tricks to where to look and where to go mount Raina is probably the mountain I was talking about earlier yeah I heard that coffee is supposed to be good as well but um yeah I can confirm yeah okay i um I went in 2018 for CubeCon and uh because I was speaking there and then when I flew into Seattle I was at the border and the sort of border agent asked me what I'm doing there and maybe I looked slightly younger than I look now but she she was asking like "What are you doing here?" Well I'm speaking at this conference and then she was like "You like really who's going to listen to you at this conference?" And then and then like well we had a good chuckle and then she asked me where are you staying and I said well I rented this Airbnb in Capitol Hill and then she just goes like as if I have to fear for my life but um uh it was actually like a very nice sort of walkable neighborhood with lots of nice uh cafes and I just looked again like it's you know when you on Google maps and you zoom in and it's all yellow things like yeah this is a nice neighbor vote now so yeah I wasn't I wasn't too far off from there so good feeling i love the idea that they nearly you they just couldn't believe you would be speaking at a conference that they nearly didn't let you into the country that's what it felt that's what it felt like yeah yeah wow anyway I was once uh I went to the US once and I just had a backpack and they just thought I was going to go and try and stay there forever um so they they nearly didn't let me in because it's like "Where's all your luggage how long are you here for?" Uh because it was literally just a backpack i just put I just chucked my clothes in so I didn't want to check a bag or anything turns out it would have been a lot quicker because I was for ages trying to convince them I'm not trying to stay and they were like "How do we how do we know how do we just said it's not that good?" Which didn't go down very well yeah no yeah don't Don't try it this time like we still need you at this conference yeah yeah yeah now I I I can share a small experience so I I have only touched on in Seattle airport uh last year I had a conference in Bellingham which is a little bit near Vancouver and it was very very first time for me to travel to states and uh I did a very rookie mistake so uh I had some um some eatable uh like fruits item in my bag and uh at the airport I have to just go to the connecting flight so I learned my lesson like don't bring that up it's uh it will take more time in the customs for you to get clear and connect go to your connecting flight so for anyone who's traveling first time to us don't do that uh it's a good tip actually it can save you a lot of time so yeah and I and then I remember like the guy asked me like what you do as I am going to a conference where I speak about Grafana and then uh is is it like a lens company i said no it's a data visualization everything and then he just said okay stop you know a lot so here you go and take take a connecting flight he's like "Yeah you you you've proven it you know enough now eat all of eat all of this stuff before you can go through and then you just have to eat all your fruit." Oh yeah that's nice though it's nice that it's nice when they let you in i always feel like I got away with something and I haven't you know what I mean and you get through you're like "Ah." But then oh yeah no reason why I can't come through but yeah I don't like it yeah all right uh I think that's it right uh do we have anything else we I think we missed one topic might I'm not sure might be um uh did we talk about the uh sessions which we have uh uh which we picked uh for this Grafana 2025 we can talk a little bit about that so we're still having a big graphana session on day two but we want to keep that a little bit secret until the conference uh you will be able to see the the keynote uh live stream um I don't think I'm not certain the graphana deep dive is going to be live streamed but but the the content of the both of these are a little bit secret otherwise from our side we have a fair amount of sessions about our other project so about our databases and how to visualize the the data in these databases using our new drill down apps uh so all of our different databases has their own dedicated drill down apps focusing on their telemetry signal so there's a good opportunity to run from them um something to said here as well is that 50% of the content is going to be from external speakers and and that's something we're very proud of um and something we want to keep keep as a rule because we want the community to share their learnings their findings and their expertise um and and one fun topic there we have is that uh Influx Data is going to be back at Grafana 25 and talk about their new storage engine and they they also talked about that at Graphfana 2015 so we're going to see the progress for 10 years of development inlex data base and that's one of the most popular databases for graphana so really keen on having showing that or having that yeah still pretty big in the IoT space that's amazing yeah I love the content i love the fact that it's community stuff because it's it's again practical it's things that you can see how it's being used and there's a lot of great things you can just steal from that basically yeah i I mean I just like the the futility of us trying to keep some things secret when we're presenting open source projects yeah I know like I'm I'm not going to say we try hard to keep it secret uh we're just not going to push it before the actual event yeah but so what what do you have to do to find out that go through the GitHub repo and try and see what's Cole talking about which commits is he referring if you're eager enough then you can definitely find it go on Cole give us a commit hash which one should we look for i'm looking forward to the AS code actually I well I love I'm working on the uh the drill down apps and I think the teams have just done kind of phenomenal there like so if you haven't seen the drill down apps do check them out um and of course will they'll be featured at graphonicon but uh yeah like you just you know I I I have to kind of I don't I never learned uh much promql and I sort of like look it up every time I need it and usually I'm playing around and things and now with the drill down apps I just don't even need to know it i can just go and find my bits without any any queries at all same for logql as well even though you know I've got a lot of respect for these um languages are they languages no are they yeah they are in QL they are from Pro from K is turning complete so that's definitely an important language is it it's not self-aware though is it no no no yeah yeah but that's just you know Yeah that that's it it's just you get to you get to just see that and I think when things just click it's it's great yeah we have three or four session on on that itself gran app so you're not going to be able to miss that if you go to graphicon mhm osman on this URL do you need that end slash at the do you actually need to put that slash in or will it work without that as well um I'm not not sure i just copy this from the browser let's try it just want to find out um don't really have to try that so yeah let us know okay does it work without the slash yeah it works okay good good to know birds of a feather birds of a feather is what you were saying right yes yeah yeah it's a It's a phrase have you heard it before i was I was trying to figure out where it's from or or what the sort of What kind of metaphor is it embracing or like uh I think it's like birds with the same kind of feathers so it's like you're like the same type of people so it's like you know it's like Yeah like Graphfana open source people are like our kind of people we're birds of a feather we're we're just we're just a bunch of a bunch of robins or Yeah that would be nice and I think we we missed all all all in the event and all the description we we we missed one important one there will be a lot of swags for everyone so all those who are joining Graphfana from the community or even first timers uh check out our booth uh there will be amazing swag you will uh yeah those are very high in demand so uh if you especially get the grot our mascot uh official mascot now I think uh so yeah definitely take as much as you can because those run out very quickly and they're very in high demand we kind of like we I remember I asked for some stickers and for growth and like oh we are we are doing but we are running so high on on demand so it's it's getting low in production and or low in distribution side so yeah so definitely a fun a fun event um definitely a big event for the community and uh talk to us uh even even in workshop or in sessions there you will have a chance to see and meet most of us yes that I remember we g we we did some competition we sometimes do a little impromptu quiz competition to give away little extras as well um I think it was in Amsterdam where I I tried to sort of kick kick one into the crowd just to sort of be cool but I'm not very good at kicking it turns out so I missed it most times um it was a bit embarrassing but hopefully no one remembers that i wasn't I'm not very good at sport in fact I got a detention at school for being so bad at tennis they thought I was messing around so he gave me detention i was like "Surely you can't have a detention for just not being good at tennis." There we go but on the bright side Matt you are the you are our most uh on demand MC in all Graphana i'm the only one that's done it aren't I no I suppose not before oh okay i I but I uh Oh you have done some other internally in the other company events as well as an MC so I do love doing it it's a lot of fun um we do we do have a lot of fun like the conferences are they're really fun you know and I don't know if that's coming across really when we just when you look at the schedule and everything because there's so much good serious stuff you might have the idea that that it's dry or it's uh you know very serious and and it's not we we have a laugh as well uh and I think that's important you know because they're long days you know and paying attention for that amount of time as well is kind of draining so it is nice to that we get to just have fun and not take ourselves too seriously as well yeah definitely all right should we wrap up yep I think so okay okay so thank you everyone i think it was a fun and very very detailed talk about Grafana and uh do check our links uh which we have posted in the chat and uh yeah and see you all in the next one till then bye-bye see you there thank you byebye bye
