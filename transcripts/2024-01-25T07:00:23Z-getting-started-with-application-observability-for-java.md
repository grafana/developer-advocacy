Transcript: if you want to instrument and enable Telemetry in your Java application to observe it detect anomalies and diagnose root causes there's a quick and easy way in three quick steps you can leverage grafana Cloud using the grafana instrumentation agent to observe your Java application so let's instrument our Java application in a quick and easy way but before we begin beware these steps help you to quickly enable observability if your Java application is in the development stage or in a pre-produced environment in productive environments it is best to use data exporter to send Telemetry data to graph Cloud more information on that is in the link above or in the video description with that cleared out let's instrument our Java application first of all we will need the grafana agent to get it we will go to the agent repository which is available in the link below once inside select the latest stable release and then click on grafana open Telemetry java. jar to download it once downloaded place it in a specific location as we will use it afterward in this step we will gather some data needed by the agent in some command line instructions which we will put inside of a shell script or a bad file if you are on Windows those commands are easy but putting them together requires us to gather information from different places so buckle up because we will jump around a bit this is because the agent needs a few things permissions to send metrics indications for naming things and a few other identifiers if you want to First the agent's Target is grafana cloud so we must access it to find the necessary details if you do not have a graph cloud account already you can get it for free at the link in the corner of the video or in the description below if this is your first time using grafana Cloud observability you must opt in for the grafana cloud metric generation note there is a cost associated with using this feature more information below all right let's create our shell file how about we name it observe my java. sh the other parameters can be copied from the documentation link above or in the video details once you have access to grafana cloud and opted in on the metrix generation go to your grafana Cloud portal which is reachable by the link displayed on the screen or in the details below if your account can access multiple Stacks or organizations first select the ones that you will work on otherwise the default stack and organization will be already selected now go to the section manage your graan Cloud stack and scroll down to open Telemetry and click on the button configure once inside of the open Telemetry configure section scroll down to the password API token section and in it click on generate now that will open a window where we must name the new token that we need to create why don't we name it quick Java to and then we will click on the create token button once create it click on close do not worry about copying the token right now we will have it in a moment now now you will notice that the password API token section contains a token but now as well underneath the environmental variable section also has some commands ready for you now it is the time to copy them warning this is a time to copy them and store them make sure you do so otherwise you may have to repeat the steps now that we have our access information ready we will paste it in our shell file once we pasted it we can go and gather the other information bits that we will need now in the copy text we must Define some tagging parameters for our agent such as the services name so let's name it my quick Java lastly we need to indicate where we Sav the agent and the path and name of our Java application here I have a super simple Java application that receives some requests here and there and response with some data delivered back to the user okay let's save our shell or bath file so that we are ready to start the magic all right now that we have the agent the information for the agent the agent's location and the Java application details we are ready to execute so it is time to run the shell or bat file this will execute all the steps that we just put together to start the Java application with the agent monitoring in it once it's running let's do some request to the application so that it begins to send some information to grafana Cloud speaking of grafana cloud let's go to our grafana Cloud platform there we must click on the menu icon in the top of the left corner then we will open the observability menu and click on application where we will now see the monitored application what there's nothing there you looking for something to show up and nothing is that yet do not worry it takes a few minutes so why don't we go and RW a nice cup of coffee to give it a few [Music] minutes all right as soon as you are back check again and you will find your new monitored application displayed there click on it and open all the Fantastic dashboards with information about your Java application and there you have it your Java application is monitored if you need more information on instrumenting productive environments please take a look at the observability documentation on the screen or in the video notes and if you have any questions or comments please leave it down below now it's time to enjoy your new superpowers of java observability have a good one
