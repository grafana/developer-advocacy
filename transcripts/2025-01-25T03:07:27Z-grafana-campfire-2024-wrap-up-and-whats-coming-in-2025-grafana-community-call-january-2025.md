Transcript: all right and we're live welcome to grafana campfire the Gana Community call this is our second one so uh hopefully people watch at least a few people have watched the first one I think we've got some some viewers on uh YouTube um this I think is the first one we're also streaming live so you could technically join a YouTube stream if we figure out a bit more of the logistics so that's also something to check out next time but yeah still me David um I'm I lead the the Gana team I'm also here with Matt ryer um senior principal engineer and Carl also senior oh no you got you changed your name to Senor principal seor principal yeah is that because you like tacos yeah pretty much yeah so we um we also we also have Osman from uh our developer advocacy team uh who's going to represent a bit the community and he's also got some questions for us later sweet but uh today I thought like after last time where we looked a bit at the sort of in between years where we didn't have the community call and everything happened this time we also want to look a bit at concretely what happened in 2024 because I think we as the team made a lot of progress but also the company made a lot of progress and then um look a bit at what we're going to to build next year and so for that we have Mitch um who is uh uh where are you you're you're a director of product right and so you're yeah you're essentially my counterpart I didn't know we were all supposed to be adding senior to our titles I feel like you could have done that too David but you know some of us are humbler than others I think thing is we're not allow to have the title for us it's important to add the title ah yes yes of course I also don't know how many characters I had left in there in the field um yeah but yeah so I'm the the the head of the product manager team for grafana which means uh yeah we're we're somewhere between uh Visionaries and uh engineering lackes something like that I guess it means also if you made a feature request and it's not in the product yet it's my fault yeah so yeah that's that's pretty much pretty much my job but yeah among that the other kinds of things that I do are track what we're to accomplish in grafana and how well we did which I think is why you you brought me here I think it's it's going to be fun to talk about what we set out to do the features we shipped and how well they helped us do that and what we ended up accomplishing last year yeah absolutely yeah so we're I mean we're also tracking a lot of kpis right um open source is a big part of our DNA that's what we also talk about internally a lot and we we track a lot of numbers there too um how's how are sort of the adoption stats right now Mitch uh pretty good so um over the last couple of years um I have been paying less and less attention to the number of instances of grafana that are out in the wild which as you know that could be an empty Dev instance or it could be you know a massive you know 20,000 user uh uh production instance used by lots and lots of people um I'm paying a lot more attention to monthly active users basically the active users number if you go and look at the the stats in the admin section of grafana we tallied those up that tells us how many users who are are currently considered active on a rolling 30-day basis um so uh last year was huge we had a 30% um active user growth um and the the sort of peak that we hit which we have a ton of seasonality as well it's sort of plummets around the holidays as everybody goes home from work and cares less about their production systems I guess um but we hit 3.2 million um active users which is a massive Community this is obviously much smaller than the total number number of users living in grafana instances these are people who signed in and used grafana in the last 30 days so that was a huge accomplishment and in fact 3.2 million specifically like to two decimal points was exactly the target we set and exactly what we hit you might think that it's very sort of a smooth curve but unlike instances uh uh active users tends to fluctuate a ton like it's it's seasonal it changes throughout the week um so it was like yeah I think it was a a fun coincidence that we actually we sort of exactly hit our goal and maybe one other notable thing here is that 30% growth is a huge difference from last year in 2023 we had 177% year-over-year active user growth and in 20 24 like I mentioned it was 30% which like a huge shift and there's something we've been you know you're constantly wondering is you know where do we sit on that sort of you know that um that classic bell curve um and and we were like oh no are we sort of hitting the taper point and what we're seeing is actually an acceleration in uh in our growth rate um which is even bigger than acceleration just in the number of users that we add every year so I yeah I was I was really um sort of I I I don't want to say surprised but I was I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that the growth rate of grafana usage is accelerating it means really good things for the community yeah 3.2 million I mean do how many of these people do you know Mitch personally I know uh 1500 you know about the number of employees in our in our company uh and we we through that that growth means we add 1,800 users every day so this is what what I mentioned in the team is like we're adding more active users every day than than the total number of people in our company it's wild yeah yeah I'd say I spend time regularly with about three and a half people so more yeah well commiserations to the half a person I hope they yeah but um I think when we look kind of in the future we sometimes also have to look a bit in the past to see like what did we do for this growth to happen right like is it accidental or does it have to do with the work that also my team has been doing and that you have been doing Mitch um is there anything where you think like this this is actually one thing that maybe the people have been waiting for and sort of accelerated the growth a bit yeah this is this is a a constant sort of calculation how did our our work impact the growth in the community or our growth as a company or any of the above and sometimes you have really direct uh connections so for example you know we'll connect with a Community member they'll be working to do something significant for a ton of their users we'll help them with it and you know as a result you know you can say I did this thing and we gained 100 users as a result but usually it's it's way more um obscured more abstracted than that um and so I would say probably most of the growth this year is actually based on the compound efforts from last year the year before um but some of the things that I think are are most interesting from an adoption perspective in the last year the the big one is the Explorer apps so like a huge majority of grafana users are monitoring kubernetes using Prometheus um or they're using Loki or Tempo or one of the new databases like for a classic software infrastructure um observability uh use case and so the Explorer app s basically open up the ability to explore those databases without knowing how to write promql and like yeah this a tale is Old As Time something we've been struggling with for years is how do we help people who don't want to learn a new query language it's a really basic problem but one that we've that we've really struggled to solve you can see over the years we've tried to do you know uh different things you know add a graphical query Builder or add a Kickstart your query option or you know like sort of uh uh trying to create better ways to query but instead uh this year and this was like a Toral a fever dream of a of a project and then a team that includes Matt uh has really built out the explore apps I think that has has resulted in a ton of usage not just of the explore apps but of grafana in general yeah I think the explor apps is from the community perspective is one of the most big hit because many users who wants to use graffan and learn how to create visualization it just give them an instance like this is if you're running in container or Local H even like something kubernetes you get everything in instance just use Prometheus so that is definitely a very big hit I must say yeah uh something else that may have gone U behind the scenes but when we actually when we look at uh users who are getting started with grafana whether it's an open source or or grafana Cloud one of the biggest drop offs the things they struggle with is connecting a data source last year we put some specific energy into a handful of data sources to see if we could make configuration easier uh and that resulted in a much better conversion rate so a lot more people were successful connecting to their their Prometheus Loki Tempo or SQL data sources and as a result I mean that's just that many more instances they get up and running and that has compound effects when they share their dashboards things like that yeah I I remember some of these problems because some you you sort of connect your database or something and then um you sort of see an error message and you don't know is it is it have I misconfigured grafana or is it is it sort of a problem with the database and you just have to kind of go back and forth and I think we've I think we gotten better now at passing the errors through right and so to make it a bit more clear like what's actionable the next step exactly one of my f favorite uh things Matt earlier this year you actually gave a talk on just being opinionated and obscuring a lot of the advanced details like okay grafana is great because it's super configurable but um one of the biggest changes that we made uh is just applying sensible defaults to as many settings on a data source as possible taking a bunch of the advanced settings and putting those in an advanced section um and and also simple bread and butter things like making sure the docs are up to date and and have good step-by-step instructions so yeah it was just all of these uh all these effects together a lot of the experiments were really successful so for example you'd have a data source where only 15% of people were successful and we got to like 50% of people were successful with that data source so now we're sort of you know we're in a little bit of a island Warfare we got to do this with every every data source now but we have a good set of principles we're working against at least yeah I love this flow I like it you know grafana started off as pretty Advanced tool it was mainly like people hacking it together themselves to get it working and things in the very early days and then over time it's just keeps improving keeps getting better and I love the F we talk a lot about that user experience internally and what that's like and how do we how do we make that smoother so it's really nice when we we hear back that we're that that's working that that sort of thinking is working yeah yeah totally like we're going from a a hardware store to to an Ikea surely yeah yeah car maybe you can help us with some of the naming of our product yeah absolutely I'd be happy to do that yeah exactly some some kitchen objects oh God yeah talking about we're uh we are also trying we're trying to rename the explore apps now as well so that's been a it's been a considerable use of my time recently to come up with a better name because we we we run into the issue now that the experience is so different from how it was before that we we that that um when we talk about the new explor apps people are like oh you know I've seen Explorer like back in the day that's is that the same uh no it's not it's it's we we it's completely query L experience right you just sort of kind of Click through filter and it just rewrites the queries for you and it's something that's been really difficult to also describe and put into a name and yeah we've had a good amount of um sort of engineering time now on on sort of a naming a naming Quest and it's hard it is it is hard yeah um I came up with explore two Judgment Day just as an idea but have that many there's definitely a good amount of sort of uh funny and B like bad names that didn't make it uh I quite like Bingo um because you just have like tiles and tiles of things and you hit the one that you're interested in game where you have to do that yeah yeah and um Sparkle was also there I was quite I thought it was quite positive yeah but the big question is really what does it look like in the navigation right like if you see Sparkle or Bingo like what do you expect behind this thing we are we all know what the Emojis would look like yeah yeah exactly but but you also want um like it should also be very descriptive enough not just in the menu but also when you then explain no no it's not the old explore experience is the new blank experience right yeah so so it's been um yeah I had I had a thought in a shower this morning like we should have also gone for something where um the four parts kind of are yeah have um like like some concept that has maybe four ingredients like The Beetles you know yeah yeah are they were they ingredients to band no I was more thinking than like who would be Ringo in this like which database yeah yeah no one wants to be Ringo bless him is that a direct translation from German if you like M of a band you're a ingredient within the band oh is it yeah yeah I guess so I guess but what about the base and like some Melody TR is that like seasoning yeah maybe yeah no but I I also had to abandon this approach because like what what if we have a fifth app like I there's no fifth Beetle right like that yeah Pete best kind of fired was he yeah so um yeah final name still out I think we have a we have a few proposals but still has to get through um sort of wider approval process here yeah yeah it's funny because it's an exercise like you could come up with an idea and then there's a b big group of people and they could be like no I don't like it and then that's it it's the ultimate bike sheding exercise yeah I don't like that name right anyway veryable naming at scale yeah yeah yeah well um sweet so um any anything else 2024 that you were excited about Mitch also made it into the product yeah I mean that so there there were a lot of things uh very visible things that came out so it wasn't just the Explorer apps but there were a ton of improvements to the canvas panel like it's a lot easier to sort of draw shapes uh import uh into the canvas panel and you can even sort of take actions like not just link from canvas but actually take actions out in another system like if you wanted to open a Jura ticket or uh we had uh uh or start stop and and restart a server like you can actually interact with other apis from within canvas it's pretty kind of skies the limit um we had a bunch of new data sources Adobe analytics yugabyte zendesk which are really interesting I think especially because they're not strictly speaking observability use cases but building towards something like not just how is my service running but how is my service doing what's the health of of it all in analytics wise support tickets wise and um or even how is my team doing so I think it's really exciting to see some of that stuff in grafana um but maybe the the sort of under thewater part of the iceberg like the big things that we're working on which we kind of in the the questions at the beginning of the call are about uh scenes and app platform so uh scenes is a new front-end framework that includes uh components like uh all of uh dashboard's panels uh like the time range picker and other dashboard components and over the course of the year we have completely Rewritten dashboards using scenes and the reason I say this is underwater is because what you can see of this right now is a slightly better reconfigured uh page like for example now you can stick template variables to the top of the page like like locking a um a spreadsheet row which I mean this is one of the biggest feature requests in grafana but it's a it's a small change we see big performance improvements um but what we're what we're about to see and this is a little bit of foreshadowing is just a lot more flexible use of dashboard layouts and conditional logic to render panels so thinking things like uh rows that can have their own independent style of layout new dashboard layouts like an auto grid that will Auto arrange um panels for you you don't have to do it manually um or even tabs and drill downs and and new ways to sort of interact with with dashboards so I'm really excited about scenes and what the future holds and it's already sort of reaping uh benefits and thenat on the explore apps just on that um I think the reason that we're able to get the explore apps out as quickly as we did was thanks to scenes really because a lot of those a lot of the sort of common problems that you have to solve for when you're building apps like this scenes kind of gives you a lot of that to go so yeah we we definitely sort accelerate um things that we can build as well so have you have you have you like programmed in scenes in Mt yeah I have oh how is that um yeah I mean it gives you like uh you have to kind of think of it slightly differently you have to sort of it gives you a slightly different model other than react um so you have to figure that out but but once you do it yeah if it depends on the kind of app you're building but if it's very sort of I mean the explor apps are all about drilling down into data and things um and you know you want things to Cascade properly and all that so yeah you get that with the scenes so yeah I think sometimes sometimes you sort of rub up against it it's like any any kind of framework if it's doing the thing you want it to do it's kind of perfect and then if you want to do something slightly different that's usually where there's some friction um but generally yeah I like how quickly we're able to get these apps out thanks to it you know yeah uh so yeah it scenes used to rewrite dashboards and then also exactly as a library um or let's sort of call it a JavaScript framework it can be used to actually write apps which we're doing with a whole bunch of apps in Cloud um the second thing which is happening more on the the back end where scenes is uh is on the front end is the the app platform where essentially we're rewriting all of the apis in grafana and also offering apps the ability to to write backends using a consistent framework use a bunch of kubernetes Concepts like the API format um and that allows for this is like a basis that's going to drive a ton of improvements in things like consistency in our apis right so as we build new apps and migrate our existing uh features on the app platform the apis are going to look and feel very consistent with each other that also allows us to do all kinds of exciting things like um have consistent terraform resources and uh consistent ways to interact with those objects as as code um in a bunch of formats some of which are probably going to be coming out in grafana 12 but yeah this is another just very foundational thing it's it's a sort of a rising tide that lifts all bows and that does bring us to another Community question we had about dashboards as code in particular um is there something for the community to do there what where are with the sort of as code what's our thinking well I can answer but I wonder Carl if you want to pitch in I can say a few words so so as code is are one of our primary uh goals for gra 12 there's going to be a lot of efforts here H I don't want to spoil too much but there's going definitely going to be talks about this at graphicon we're going to do workshops about this at graphicon both for existing tooling and also a very exciting new tooling and feature that we're adding so this is um as code is grao toil for sure like it's the year of fast code for us exciting and the consistence apis are really really important because the API of was kind of homegrown H it just grow and existed to help the frontend do as little work as possible the new API is stand standardize around the same API format that commin has which means it's going to be easier to move objects around between servers and and uh just do crowd operations in a consistent way so once you learn the format you're going to be able to interact with any resource yeah yeah it is exciting I mean it's exciting building in that way as well because of a lot of the stuff you're going to get for free yeah I love in app platform you put a resource and you can kind of watch that resource and you can even watch it from the front end so you know building synchronous building anything that has to sort of stay in sync um or have real time elements to it all that stuff becomes much easier to do as a developer uh and then I think the KnockOn effect of that means the apps will just get better and better and richer and more useful and feel more rapid and all that all that great stuff yeah I think this uh dashboard escort will be definitely a big uh big surprise and big uh big winner in my opinion because this is something from the last year when I talk with the community or just been in in talks uh this question always arriv and uh yes we are working and as as car said that uh something will be very nicely and very big announce in the granon so stay tuned for the ganoon as well yeah exciting I mean it gets very you know if you've used any of the AI assistance to help with writing code and things um having as code as an option for grafana means you can also use the AI to essentially help with your all your observability stuff as well so that that really is going to unlock a lot I think um and also it's given me some ideas for different hackathon projects yeah I was I was curious I think there we all sort of change quite a bit under the hood right um we had to introduce the proper schemas right for dashboards what were the difficulties there Carl uh that's a good question I don't have a lot of uh inp knowledge but we we have evaluated a fair amount of different uh Frameworks for doing schemas uh I think we're still relying on Q for that um but one of the biggest obstacle for this is that the dashboard Json has not had a real schema for 10 years so most of the the code for keeping uh dashboards up to date because you can still build a dashboard in 2 and import it into 10 all of that like Logic for enabling that has been in the front end only uh and that's a little bit limiting if we want to do things like linting and validation so re like like taking all of that old knowledge and turning that into a schema is is a big challenge working on but dashboard V2 is going to be where we take like um defin definitive St into schematizing everything and making everything propably usable from as code and like a c as one so that's interesting that it never had a schema this far and um what what kind of challenges did that create was it like because if if you're writing code to generate the dashboard Json to create dashboards um does that did that change did that suddenly break between major version versions and things nothing breaking because we have a lot of transformation in the front so whenever you load a dashboard Json it it runs through this number of uh Transformations depending on the revision number in your dashboard Jon wow so that's that's how you can run through all dashboards but this creates a big problem because you cannot say validate all my current dashboards like are my dashboards okay these these are questions are very hard to answer so you you always get into this position where you have a might have a lot of dashboards you might that that is key problem here right you might have a lot of dashboards in your database that you are not sure it's going to work in the next version even if like we try and take make a lot of big efforts around it it's not guaranteed in the same way as if we had schemas there's also a big problem in Gana where we have so many plugins right so a data source Plugin or a panel Plugin or app plugin how they deal with the data structures and and new versions of Gana might not be as perfect or good in any way either uh so this is also something we need to schematize and this is a big effort but we're starting and we're making sure that dashboard is getting there and it's going to be a thing from going forward for sure yeah it's exciting especially with like the versioning and all that that will be managed and any automatically generated clients and stuff I get very excited still about things like that yeah there's like a there are so many layers to this problem you say okay you know layer one well it's hard for me to define a dashboard in code format or generate it uh you know from a library and it's hard for me to keep up with say changes in the API or the API for dashboards and the API for um annotations feel different you know inconsistent with each other so we get these problems on the surface but to fix them you know we have to go all the way to the source which is well what is the definition of a dashboard what is a report and are those definitions consistent with each other and then the apis are those apis consistent with each other and then the clients you know are the ways that you would interact with those apis like our terraform provider or a CLI um or you know or even our you know our docs themselves are those all consistent with each other and if we start from sort of the base layer which we have been doing then a lot of the other stuff can sort of flow up and you get you know a cleaner more consistent um set of interfaces that stay up to date over time yeah I think it's I think it's really kind of fortuit is that we're that also doing this while we're changing the overall architecture right like I feel like this is a this is kind of when you when you're like redoing the kitchen and you got all the stuff out you might as well sort of change the wallpaper because you just it's like it's the chance you have like once once in 10 years um there there is you mentioned terraform already apis right I I I feel like we've implemented kind of the exporting and importing out of of dashboards sort of in three different things already right and I think that probably contributed to the messiness and to that it's not clear which road to take and uh they all have some certain advantages and um so that's been a big part I think also for the upcoming works that'll be for Ganon to really figure out uh can we get this to one solid story that uh it's sort of very obvious to do like or it's obvious what to do and which tool to use yeah I think we're quite lucky because the grafana project lived long enough that we need to do these big foundational changes to the project early on we went really fast and we tried to get adoption and and get a feature out there right uh but both scenes and our platforms are are these larger initiatives that needs to happen for it to prosper for the next 10 years and I'm very keen on both of them and and the direction both of them are taking since is basically completed at this point but but that platform is going to be remain a project a quite large project for a long time so let's so we have as code right as a big thing that's coming up for the upcoming year anything else we want to do Mitch uh the yeah I mean how how much time do we have um I think the other the other thing that I get really excited about which is just whatever else is happening in grafana we are improving the way that you get data like like the the data sources um what they can do and how easy it is to to query them we're always improving the panels and visualizations and we're always improving dashboards and the and the sort of the flexibility functionality of dashboards so in that realm there's a ton of things to talk about but I think the most uh exciting one for me me to think about is dynamic dashboards um and and dynamic dashboards means dashboards that respond a little bit better to what the viewer is doing with them um or or which allow for a little bit more conditionality so this is kind of an abstract way of describing it but today right you create a dashboard you can create template variables when you select a template variable that can affect the data that's displayed in a query but it can't affect things like which panels show up um or uh or uh which which rows are uh prioritized um it can affect things like well you know what what uh time range is selected in the time range picker and if you select one template variable um and you want it to uh to be reflected the values of that template variable to be reflected differently by different data sources or different panels things like that are impossible and while these feel like edge cases there are a thousand of those edge cases and all and many people who are trying to create a dashboard of any level of complexity run into at least one of those so this is what I me when I say okay the promise of scenes is dynamic dashboards which for me basically means being able to do more with fewer dashboards like my dream the thing that I think is going to be really exciting and we can make real this year is where previously I would have to create seven separate dashboards for my Reddit cluster or my Javas spring boot app like one for each facet or one that you know a high level View and another at another level at a lower level of detail I could accomplish that with just one right so for example I have a highle uh list view that shows um that shows me my kubernetes cluster with a list of PODS I click on a pod and I go into a tab or sort of a subview of that same dashboard which shows me the information related to that pod with just the uh the panels or panels floated to the top that have the highest level of priority um and so you're really being able to create a more um a more Dynamic interactive view uh of dashboards just more powerfully but with the same level of flexibility so basically that means that these dashboard will be uh depend on on the user Behavior like what they want to view rather than the dashboard decide itself that this is high priority for me so I should uh show these result is it correct exactly exactly like generally speaking right now ingana a dashboard is a dashboard and you know the view you look at is the view that was created by the editor but there are just so many different different conditions that could cause a user to want to see something a little bit different including things like that user's specific permissions and so you know we're interested in exploring things like data source permissions that are more granular than just a single set of credentials so that users are seeing what they should be able to see as opposed to you know some sort of generic uh generic view um yeah there's like you know a lot of permutations but throughout the year think what what you'd expect you should expect to see is uh dashboard options and tools that allow you to sort of tailor the dashboard view to you know what that user needs in that moment and therefore you're going to be able to do a lot more a lot more monitoring uh give people an overview of their systems with fewer dashboards exciting I'm very I'm very bullish on this because in reality when whenever you're making changes to your system uh let's say you have 10 different clusters and you want to start running a r in one of them then then you're going to have this weird position like what what do I have in my dashboard do I have my Cas re like now you would be able to have two when you have more conditional rendering and and let the data s dashboards render either depending on what you're looking at and and those kind of more Dynamic behaviors are going to be very very useful in grafana because the the systems are always changing and and when you have both that leads to this like mess uh uh within the dashboards yeah this gets you like a much more mature practice right where you like the more sort of reusability you have also the more sort of quality you usually get and uh there there's a fair amount of features that are going that direction for us now totally and then in the in the realm of data sources um you know we were talking about configuring a data source which is hard and a lot and a lot of people sort of uh struggle at that step uh but that's a thing that you do once right and so like with with data sources internally we talk about can I find the data source I'm looking for can I find that you know that I can connect my data and then can I configure it and then can I query it sort of get to the point where I'm getting value out of using that data so in that in that third box can I query it um I'm pretty excited about uh uh additional things we're working on as well so for example some data sources like if I'm querying my SQL that you know there are as many there as many SQL queries and table types as there are sort of uh people uh using using grafana but for a data source like GitHub well there are a pretty concrete and finite set of things that people can query and GitHub and a pretty predictable set of use cases so I'm interested in exploring and experimenting with well hey how can we make it easier for people to do those common things in GitHub just like we've been we did with the you know sort of Prometheus lokian Tempo uh uh with the explore apps but in a really Flex big tent way um one of the things that I think could be could be great there is also making better use of community dashboards right working those a little bit more closely into the app so that when you set up a data source that has pretty consistent data model um we can give you the benefit of the community's expertise and uh and contributions there to pick out a dashboard or other information that people have already created yeah okay there this question came in from the community from undefined human um they're asking about tency here in out of the box features like app front end observability infrastructure and things but generally like tency how do we think about that um and is there you know is app platform going to help there as well by tency I wonder do we mean multi-tenancy or like running these a separate processes from uh from uh grafana it's good question undefined human I mean I can't ask them can I I don't know who they are um tell us a bit about that though I well yeah I don't know what they mean really I mean I um I think it's in the second part right like making the data sources selectable so could you have a Gana instance where you have essentially tenants by data source so you have five tants means you have you have five Prometheus data sources so that in your app o you can select which Prometheus should be the underlying thing um and I think that's not possible right because it's one stack right is that true Mitch do you remember uh it is so I think our intention basically with building out uh app observability front end observability asserts is that those are easy to use and they work consistently when you're using the graphic Cloud stack so it may be possible to in in uh the future including this year to choose from multiple Stacks in uh in Cloud say when I'm using kubernetes monitoring or maybe maybe even better for us to combine the data from those Stacks so you don't really have to worry about a concept like data sources if you're just trying to to monitor your kubernetes clusters um the thing that we're unlikely to do because we're really we're sort of building specifically on the cloud stack and some of the the the um unique features that are offered in the databases there we're we're not planning to say make app observability work with any Prometheus data source or any Loki data source some of the limitations of self-managed Prometheus or Loki data sources are um are uh make that in infeasible and for us to have this really opinionated specific view on the state of your clusters or the state of your app uh we need the whole stack to be working together but yeah like viewing multiple multiple Stacks is potentially in the cards yeah okay so just a quick reminder we will answer your questions if you come and ask them we'll ask we'll ask them we'll put them to the panel live um we're happy to do that um another one came in that's related to what you're talking about Mitch uh currently explore metrics only works with the Prometheus data source is it is it planned that we extend this to other data sources and why why is it only available for the Prometheus data source sure yeah I could I could just as easily ask you that question Matt since you're since you're working on it um yeah my answer is we're planning yeah um yeah we we're planning for this to specifically and only support the Prometheus data source um why it's basically because uh explor metrics is possible meaning like a totally clickable sort of uh exploratory experience is possible because we're doing Prometheus specific stuff um if we if we tried to generalize explore metrics to work with any metrics uh data source we would have to make it more generic making it more generic makes it a little bit trickier to use brings us kind of back full circle to to something like explore classic where you're just executing a query against a data source we've tried in the past to make really flexible clickable experiences there and I think we've done pretty well um you know from the perspective of querying just any data out in the world explore metrics is designed specifically to work with Prometheus and specifically so that somebody can uh can use it to to best effect yeah and it's it's never it's never say never on this because you never know where we're going to go with it but uh the same is true for logs as well logs is built explore logs is built on top of Loki and there are some like Loki specific there's like some dedicated apis in Loki to power the the explor logs experience um and obviously we can't easily go and do that with another log provider I think this is yeah sorry go ahead I was gonna say it's almost more accurate to think of explore metrics as a front end for Prometheus uh as as opposed to a graphon feature that queries metrics so I think this is an important step where we not lock down to the old data source query format but they go beyond that to solve a certain use case and like in take a step forward as uh a product or project because otherwise you're going to be limited to that contract forever um but when you expand Beyond this contract you cannot do that for every data source initially so so this is a consideration like longterm do we want to figure out the real contracts here or standardize on them or do we want to keep experimenting with these specific data sources because we not might not be at the stage yet where we want to say this is the contract anyone can Implement those contracts because it's it's still young right yeah yeah I mean uh I think it's also just a nice Roundup that we have essentially clickable front ends for all our sort of open open source uh sort various Telemetry data sources right because this is all sort of Prometheus mimir Loki Tempo and pyroscope right like these are the front ends that you can now use uh like for free right to just uh already get a pretty good experience um and um for us it's yeah like it's still adoption is still the big part of of like what the company wants to achieve yeah and I think also if we did that thing where we we support all these different data sources we we could still have very conditional bits in the front end that only show up in certain conditions and things but we're very sensitive about not wanting to deliver degraded experiences depending on what you've got going on um you know so because we we want that to be yeah top quality you know nice experience that it's just the best it can be and it's harder to do that if you have to you know certainly harder to test right you have to test all these permutations all of a sudden um so it's kind of yeah load of challenges technically as well but um yeah it is interesting I think this is why I I always recommend to people to get in touch and tell us what you're doing tell us what you think and what you need um you know because it really makes a difference with how we make decisions yeah I think Matthew rais a very good point about the the quality which we want to deliver and uh I think we we are currently okay we have a Prometheus for explore matric but if someone may be using some other open source or or other data sources they can still go to the classic Explorer and they can still get all the data we also have uh very much polish and improve a lot of new features and and did a lot of bug fixes also in the documentation side as well for the explore so uh everyone should try that out as well yeah all right do we have any other questions from the community Osman um I don't have this at the moment but uh maybe I can also talk a little bit about grafana Champions program if sure yeah so um um I would like really like to uh start with this that um we started this program some time ago I was also like one of the initials uh who were working on like making this a project and I'm very happy to say that now this program is uh very widely spread we have with like around the air we have now uh more than 100 users uh in the channel uh this is uh great because now with them we are working actually almost on many uh many different things like we are trying to solve a lot of our community related issues also working on GitHub or uh just uh something related to documentation uh some of those folks also actually volunteer to become like maintainer like such as I know one individual who is now a maintainer of our grafana Helm chart which is amazing because this is something uh from a little background that it was little hard to find someone who can do this or agree to do this and now we have some Champions who are doing this so this is great and I will really recommend any of uh uh open source Community users either using grafana or or no even prome or any other tool related to Vis visualization join our grafana Champions program it has really a lot of perks and uh goodies for you and uh yeah um we will be happy to get you on board so yeah that's that's all I have at least for now and yeah one small thing uh related to also this program uh Al through we we project what are the perks but one main perks which I actually love is that we have a dedicated Gana Champions channel uh where we work actually with them and this is amazing because as a champion you can actually talk to our Engineers ask them directly some questions and also get some sneak peek to what's coming new in the future so you can maybe work with us test it out and see okay this is good this is something I'm really interested or uh make some improvement to make it even better so yeah good pitch did get did they get any swag oh yeah definitely swag is the most important part we really care about the swag and um uh you you definitely get also um we have also gamified so uh depends like there's there's a minimal limit but if you if you are going or you're super interested to go AB boat you get some nice swags and everyone love sex I also love sex also I'm not a champion but I wish I could be at the same time not a lot can you can you not be a champion if you work for graffo labs then you have to resign first yeah you have to do the first part you have to qu and then become a j okay well there you go something to look forward to yeah yeah speaking of things to look forward to Carl you wanted to talk a little about uh upcoming events too right yeah I'm trying to share my screen can we can we put that one in in the scream some yeah so graphicon 2025 May 6 to 8 of May in Seattle the cfp is still open there's so you still have about a week to send your submission and it's going to be in M Hall in so look at this place like it's it's looks really nice oh wow imagine being there on stage or in the audience consuming so much new graphon content and meeting the full uh community so very excited about this um and yeah please apply if you have something you want to share about graan con about grafana our community or any of our open source project not just graan itself but mimir Loki H pyroscope Tempo is it's all open um yeah this this old image is from graphicon 18 in amstan um not sure want to watch that one let's go back to this one I like the second one that that room looks amazing yeah it does AI generated is that a real photograph it's absolutely real we spent a lot of time trying to find a venue that felt um should have a strong Community WI and like give a certain vibe to these presentations not we didn't want to uh just had office space in some big building somewhere downtown so took us a fir amount of time to find this place in Seattle looks yeah it looks incredible yeah I think like any venue where you need like the fish eye effect is capture at all already sort of makes like it's small enough to feel venue I mean I think we could do some stand up there look as well in front of that curtain M I'm pretty sure we can yeah I mean you're hosting right Matt or I'll be hosting it yeah so I'll essentially will be doing stand up yeah last year we sold out by the way quite quickly so if you want to get your ticket make sure to get it quickly good tip uh someone's also asking is there a swag at Ganon pretty sure we haven't nailed the details around it yet but there's always Swag yeah yeah uh there's another question here from Juan Carlos um where can I get info on an alloy complete exercise to collect Lambda Matrix with AWS power tools and visualize it in a dynamic SRE grafana dashboard so I wonder where you would would get stuck there the most um I think uh I think Jay may have posted a a a response there right on the screen okay yeah the response here uh we do have a AWS Cloud integration that will give you these metrics out of the box and we're also going to have an alloy tutorial we might have an alloy and Telemetry Workshop atanon as well so check your newsletters yeah no I think yeah that exists um also if the uh our own exporters are not doing it and the tutorials aren't doing it for you there's also an alloy um Community call right where you can sort of figure out the essentially the collection of the metrics because I think with kind of coming from the grafana side should be easy right and I feel like this might be more an alloy um an alloy problem but uh I'm not sure yeah and also um I just wanted to highlight one important thing here um since this question come like how like how to use aloy with different thing maybe there are many users who still might be struggling so we have this link I just posting this uh uh link to the in our chat just give me a moment and what is it link to yeah it links to actually killer Koda so my spell mistake it's Skiller Koda so basically if you go there and you just click on this link you will L to the grafana lab Skiller Koda exercises and we do have like a uh like a demo based exercise how to use uh how to getu start with alloy and done certain metrics uh all the lab environment is predefined so only you have to follow the instruction to understand like how it works in general um yeah so this can really help uh anyone who wants to ramp up their skills of using aloy killer side is that like when you if you were to murder or murderer yeah yeah I think that's what that is that's a that's a startup name free so if you're if you're thinking of doing a startup where you go around killing murderers the name is in the bag killer Coda yeah yeah yeah oh you know what we didn't do Matt we didn't do your quiz no we didn't do the quiz we'll do a quiz next time uh do quiz next time yeah we'll open with a question and then uh you can have a guess through the episode and then we'll reveal the answer at the end of the episode starting next so bit a bit like a bit like Dora the Explorer you like have to pay attention yeah it very much that's where a lot of a lot of our ideas comes from Dora that's where the explore apps came from originally probably where the background of this call came from yeah exactly yeah it's either gonna be this or Bluey I love Bluey no everyone loves blurry I don't know just makes me feel inadequate yeah I've heard [Music] um I think that's it today for today then right so uh thanks a lot Mitch for joining this group and uh thanks Osman for representing the community also uh thank you to all the hosts and I think that's another campfire in the Box another campfire in the box that's the saying in the box or in the books in books yeah yeah it's a fire hazard really is it yeah yeah it is all right we got gra incident tool that we can use if that [Laughter] happens all right see you all next time thanks everyone thank you catch lat
