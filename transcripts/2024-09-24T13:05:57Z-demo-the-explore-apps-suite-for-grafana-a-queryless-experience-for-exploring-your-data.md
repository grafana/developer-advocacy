Transcript: Hi, I'm Mat Ryer from Grafana Labs, and I'm excited to share with you updates
on our Explore apps. Check this out. The Explore apps are built
on top of Grafana Labs' open
source databases, Mimir, Loki, Tempo, and Pyroscope.
With Explore apps, you don't need to learn the individual
query languages to get your data. We've built a new suite
of point-and-click, web-based experiences that unlock the
power of the databases and make it available to everybody. They surface insights automatically and
provide easy tools to drill down into interesting areas. We've seen it dramatically cut down the
time it takes to diagnose some incidents internally and from
feedback from our customers. Explore Metrics makes it trivial to
browse your telemetry data in Mimir, scroll through visualizations of the
data or search for something specific. Like with all the Explore apps, you can easily spot spikes or dips
and investigate further. From here, Explore Logs creates beautiful
visualizations of your data in Loki. If your logs are sent with labels that
describe the pod service component or application they're coming from, you can easily see unexpected
spikes in log volume, which is usually a sign
that something is up. Explore Traces presents detailed
visualizations of your Tempo trace data in aggregate so you have a good picture of
where time is spent doing work in your systems. You can pinpoint performance
issues, investigate causes of errors, and drill down further just
by pointing and clicking. Explore Profiles gives you even deeper
insights into your stack with Pyroscope. Illuminate emerging performance issues
across your services by browsing the visualizations in aggregate,
or focus in, add filters, and look at it from different
angles. So that's the Explore apps. Explore Metrics and Explore Logs
are now generally available, and Explore Profiles and Traces are
available in public preview. Put together, this suite of tools gives
you, not just SREs, everybody, everything they need to run and operate
their systems without even writing a query. Please check out
each app's individual video
posted alongside this video, and thank you for watching.
