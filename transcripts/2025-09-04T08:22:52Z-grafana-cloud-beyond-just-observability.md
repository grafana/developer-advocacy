**Introduction**

Hello everyone, my name is Yanovat, but you can call me Over. I am an Infrastructure Architect for container and observability solutions at Claas. Today, I will discuss observability and take a look at another side of the Grafana Cloud.

I've been working at Claas in the IT department for almost 10 years, and I have 25 years of experience as a volunteer at the fire department. In my free time, I also work at Airbeat One, a large music festival in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which attracts around 80,000 people on the campground. As the person responsible for communication and technology for the fire and rescue service at Airbeat One, I've had some exciting experiences. Additionally, I completed a hardware refresh for the data center in Hamburg about 12 years ago. I enjoy working with Ubiquiti Networks hardware and other IT projects in my spare time, and like many of us, I love a good barbecue.

**Claas Overview**

Claas is a family-owned company founded in 1913, located in North Rhine-Westphalia, near Bielefeld. We are one of the international leaders in agriculture technology, specializing in agricultural machinery like harvesters, combines, mounted equipment, and wheel loaders. Our focus is on innovation and high-quality technologies, with a commitment to sustainable solutions and digital advancements. We employ around 12,000 people worldwide, operate in over 100 countries, and have 38 sites across the globe. 

**The Importance of Agriculture**

To give you an overview of the agriculture sector's importance, let’s consider how many products in the market are related to farming. Please raise your hand if you believe over 50% of the products are related to farming. (Audience participation) 

If you ask ChatGPT, it would say that at least 70 to 80% of products are related to agriculture, including everyday products like apples or juice, as well as cosmetics made from plant-based oils. Agriculture plays a crucial role in fulfilling market needs.

**Observability Stack at Claas**

At Claas, we are utilizing the Grafana Cloud observability stack across nearly all products. Currently, we are using about 50% of the Grafana Cloud stack. We are actively working with metrics, logs, and have implemented metric forecasting and anomaly detection.

Our tech stack includes hyperscale solutions, MongoDB for the backend, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and SAP for enterprise resource planning. We also use Rancher for Kubernetes development and tools from Doul Systems for engineering.

**Understanding Observability**

When we think about observability, we consider tools available from AWS to ZenDesk, enabling integration with various products in our company's landscape. Technicians can drill down into the system, inspecting CPU, RAM, and storage metrics, along with logs. In contrast, management typically prefers a simplified view—such as a traffic light system indicating system health.

Grafana's observability solutions allow us to monitor a wide range of technologies, including Salesforce, SQL Server, and SAP. This integration is not only about metrics monitoring and log management but also about utilizing these systems as data sources for deeper insights.

**Examples of Data Usage**

1. **End-to-End Monitoring**:
   For instance, in a CI/CD pipeline, one might use Selenium for testing. However, true end-to-end monitoring requires validating not just the user side but also ensuring that data, such as addresses, is correctly stored in the database after a transaction.

2. **User Registrations and Purchases**:
   If a website experiences issues with user registrations while purchases continue, it could lead to a misleading interpretation of database growth. By monitoring user registration metrics alongside database entries, we can gain insights into user behavior and identify issues in real-time.

3. **Marketing Campaigns**:
   If we send a marketing newsletter to 10,000 recipients, we can track responses. However, if 2,000 emails bounce back, our effectiveness is not accurately represented. By integrating data from our mailing systems and tracking actual engagement, we can present a clearer picture of our marketing campaign's success.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, integrating various data sources into our observability solutions allows us to go beyond simple metrics and gain deeper insights into our operations. It’s about fostering a mindset within our teams to think critically about the data and its implications for our business.

Are there any questions? 

**Audience Questions**

1. **Centralization of Observability Mindset**:
   We aim to propagate this mindset across different divisions within the company. We engage with observability teams to ensure they think about what additional benefits can arise from using integrations as data sources.

2. **Enabling Teams**:
   We start by making connections between IT solutions and business needs. As teams create dashboards and share insights, management becomes interested in exploring more data sources, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of inquiry and improvement.

3. **Choosing Grafana Cloud**:
   We initially used the open-source Grafana stack but transitioned to Grafana Cloud due to the need for comprehensive support and ease of management across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

4. **Data-Driven Transformation**:
   Claas was data-driven before adopting Grafana Cloud, but the platform has significantly improved our ability to visualize and access data, contributing to our ongoing data-driven initiatives.

Thank you for your attention!

## Raw YouTube Transcript

Please Alex, thank you for your introduction. My name is Yanovat or just call me Over. I'm infrastructure architect for container and or obsibility solution at class and I will take a look just beyond obsibility. So we heard today already a lot of um using the obsibility stack from Grafana and I will take a look just a little bit on another side of the Grafana cloud. So just a small introduction of my person. So I'm almost 10 years working at class in the IT department. I have been 25 years working as an volunteer for the fire department. um already also connect collected in um Zilmanis Anahin from the in minister of Nland West failure and um in my free time I'm just also working at the airbeat one that's an big music festival in Meckllinburg for pomman we are talking about 80,000 people being on the campground uh when the festival is running so it's the sec second biggest city in Melbour for performance for that time. Um I'm responsible for everything about communication and technology for fire and rescue service at that airbeat. Um I'm also did the hardware refresh of the day pop in Hamburg around 12 years ago and I'm in my time at home really enjoying working with Ubiquity Networks hardware and some other IT stuff and I also love a good barbecue like the most of us maybe. Um just a little fun fact we are also using graphana at the airbe one for the system obsibility we are using graphana at home at me and we are also planning to use graphana in the fire department for our network obserability. Um small introduction of class class is making agriculture machinery. So who is knowing class already from the press or from at home? So okay I see some hands maybe the half of the round. So Glass is a familyowned uh company founded 1913. We are living in N West failia and has wingal that's near Bill. I think everybody was responsible for soccer knowing Bill. It's three days um we are one of the international leader in agriculture technology. solar harvest machinery, combines and um mounted equipment, wheel loaders and some other stuff. We stand for uh innovation and some high quality technologies. So we focus on sustainable solutions digital um technologies and more around that we are around 12,000 employees worldwide and we have a big um presence on the whole globe. So we are in 38 sites with with different types of companies and we are operating in over 100 countries worldwide. So just a small introduction of my person and the company and um we already seen the Jet GPT logo today. So to to just get a little bit an overview what is agriculture what is farming doing for the world we can take ch and insert a little question about how many% of the products in the legal has a direct or indirect um responsible to or is related to farming. So please raise your hand if you think more than 50% of the legal is related to farming. 50% okay obviously um who is thinking more than 70% of the lead is okay it's just the most of the round so you're right if you ask jet GPT for that question JBT answers that at least 70 to 80% of the products in a little is related to farming so you can think about the normal um products like apple or juice or something like that but you can also think about um cosmetics products with plant-based oils um about tea and some many other products. So farming is one of the driver for getting the fulfillment of a little shop or ali or something else a little bit around our tech stack. So um we are using obvious the graphana stack at the cloud with nearly every products that is placed we are using around 50% of the graphana cloud stack until now. So as we um today already start with one products get it included take the next product get it included and so on and so on. So we are already working with um everything around metrics. We are using everything around locks. We are using the first products with metric forecast and anomaly detection uh and some more stuff about that. Of course we are using some kind of hyperscaler for solutions. We are using products like MongoDB for back end. Um we using Kubernetes. Okay. I think it's not really special about that. We are German company. So we also use SAP. Um we are one of the biggest customers at Zuza so for operating system and therefore we also use Rancher for Kubernetes um development and we are also using Doul systems for everything about engineering. So that's just an introduction in our text. It's a little bit more bigger but the slide would be fully blown if I place everything on that. So let's switch back to or beyond just obsibility presentation. So if if we think about obsibility normally we have management we have and if we thinking about that big tent that already mentioned today we can use obsibility nearly from AWS to Zenesk. So you can nearly include every product into the graphana obsibility solution and you can use it for nearly any layer in your company. So if you start with our technicians we can u just take our old school PC we can use um our inspector kruo and he will drill down in that solution. He will just inspect that. He will use the normal metrics like CPU like RAM like storage get a little bit um information about that. Maybe he will also take that service running on the system in his obsability story taking something like active sensions for a database CPU time for some database request and some more and maybe he will also do some lock management for that and after that what will come that then we will take the application the whole application um landscape in solution and take something like response duration. So we are using tracing. So that's our technician. He will really drill down in the system. He will take a deep look on something like metrics on log files and many more. And the management the management often not will use toolings like that. So the management is more like ample system just losing a green light or a yellow light or a red light. So for getting some something like an easy um something like an easy um insight into that um system into that landscape. So maybe only one light for getting a whole overview of my landscape of my digital solution um for that. So technicians drill down management more like a simple overview and I already mentioned about RVS and endes. So what's else? Graphana is um responsible for that big tent and we are also using that big tent. Um you have seen our tech stack and we are using lot more technologies in our digital solutions. So we also using something like Salesforce, MongoDB, SQL server, SAP and you can include all that system on two ways. You can use it as an integration your obsibility stack. So you can make metrics monitoring, you can make lock management for that and many more. And you can also use it as a data source. Why is that interesting to use it as a data source? because you have many more information in the system just using CPU or RAM usage or storage usage. So you have much more options to take a look into that system for um also obserability just only saying okay how many customers I have it's a simple chart on a dashboard and that's one information but you can use much more and I will take a look on three small examples for that one example is end to end monitoring you already heard about that so you have your CI/CD pipeline you're using something like Selenium or kitchen testing for that solution or you maybe also use synthetics monitoring or K6. So obviously you push your code, you build your software, you will deploy it and you will test it. Maybe with that kitchen testing you will have a browser session that will open that website search for an item. If you say you have something like an like an shop solution which search for an item, it will add that item to your shopping cart and will make something like an out and exit. So that's all. Is that already end to end monitoring? Maybe not. You only have tested it from your customer side but you have not looked on your information in for example that SAP system. You have inserted some information with like an address or with some payment information and you have tested if the website is reacting in a way you think it should. But is the data right? What is if the data is not right? If your address is maybe wrong. If there is something with an formatting error or your address data is not saved to the database. you will not look into that database and search for the for that address data and check that data. So is the address exactly the same address I have inserted in my selenium test first if you do that you will have something like end to end monitoring because you will check the data inserted in that browser session to your system you will look okay is it is address data in my database the same like I have inserted before then you have something like end to end monitor maybe we can do a little bit more about that but if you're not using your SAP system or your Salesforce or what else for a data source you're not able to look into that data and say okay is the data the same I have inserted before another small example you have a web shop you have around 100 user registrations per hour on a normal day um you have around 1,000 purchases in your shop system per today it's more or less it's it's really much less than Amazon has and you have some other activities on your database let's say it's an SQL database or something else and the other activities on the database is if you're moving some shop items in your storage or if you deliver something you have some actions on the database and customer is placing an order you say okay I will take that order I will um make an an commission of that and I will send that products to the customers. Normally you can do some metric monitoring on the database mount and see okay is my database growing. If it's not growing anymore something magic is happening maybe an deployment is going wrong or something else um please send me an alert if it's not growing anymore. Is that all we see? We have 1,000 activi 100 activities per minute on the database. We have 1,000 purchases on the database. So the database will grow still if only one of that will not working anymore. So maybe let's say you're doing a software deployment, you send a new version of your website to the cloud or to your shop system and the user is not able to register to make the registration process anymore. Maybe because he's not getting the email or the email compliant is not working fully. So the users is not able to fulfill the user registration. The database you're still getting your purchases. So the database is still growing but the user is not able to take the registration anymore. So you lose 100 user registrations per hour and after that you will use the purchases in the shop. But the growing of the database it's still there. You will not see it. It's too less 100 user registration with the other key effects on the database is too less. You will you can monitor you can try to monitor that but you will get really m much of false positives because you're getting little bit difference on the night or something like that but you can use the database as a data source you can look inside in the tables of the data source how many user registrations how many purchases and you can really use the data placed in your SQL database for observability and you can see oh hey I have done a new shop version with my software deployment and the user registrations is not growing anymore. I have not my 100 user registrations per hour and you can see that and you can use metrics forecast for analysis on that and can see okay my table is still growing. So my shop some parts of the shop is still in function but the user registration is not. You can see that if you integrate your SQL database as a data source. Last example, let's switch over to a really other department. Let's say we are using a mail campaign for the marketing. Let's think about we sending out a marketing newsletter with some information about new special products, new rabbit u information or something like that. We are sending that out to 10,000 recipients. around 3,500 of that person that is receiving it's receiving that newsletter is clicking on the link and open your shop and using that rabbit code. So 35% reaction is that all do I really know if 10,000 persons I have sent the mail to have received that email? Maybe not. But how to get information about that? We have our mailing agents that send the the mails out. We can use lock management to include the auto response from the other mail systems that saying oh that mailbox is not existing anymore or sorry that mailbox is already filled or sorry what else? And if you take that into account for 10,000 recipients, it's it's not 10,000 recipients anymore because around 2,000 is not getting that email. 2,000 persons of my marketing campaign is not able to use that rabbit code. And if we then take that 3,500 clicks on the link, it's not 35% reaction, but it's 43.75% reaction. So nearly 50% reaction. It's much other count for a marketing campaign than 35% reaction. So it's about not only integrate all my IT systems into the obsibility cloud from Grafana. It's not only taking the integration path because Grafana you you can use around 80 integrations for different products in that big tent but you're also able to use more than 100 data sources inside in the Kafana cloud. So you're able nearly all products you can integrate into your observability solution to use it as a data source and just go a step to the side of your obserability journey to see more information to take a deeper look in what is obserability? What can I do more with my data? Not only the integration. I hope it was able to understand what I what is the meaning of my presentation to to not only make that integration but going a step more to that data. So is there any questions? Oh, that ask questions. No, don't be afraid. No, but this um kind of detect detective work to look behind the curtain and and ask additional questions to get the observability. Is this something you have centralized in your company or do you propagate this mindset into the different divisions of the company? We we are trying to do both. We are trying to get in contact with our observability teams to to the teams that is using our obsibility solution and we are trying to enable them to be something like open-minded with with some open eyes and think about what's more to come and every time we are using an we we are taking another product and integrating it in the obserability solution we are saying okay it's integrated we are taking metric monitoring we are lock management we are using something like tra management And what else can we do with that integration? Should we use it as a data source? And if yes, what could be the the the benefits for the company if we are using that as a data source? because integrating it in as a data source it's not cost money for the graphana cloud because you're not moving your data from your on-prem or your cloud solution or any other place into graphana but you're only saying okay I use something like private data connect or service now or what else to include that data so it's really easy and it's a really let's say some lowhanging fruits to enable as the data source and propagate it to the teams and say Okay, now you're able to use it. Please open your mind. Think about what could we do with the information stored in that as a data source. So just trying to enable the teams. All right. Thank you. Any more questions? There's a question. Several questions. Jesus. Um just to add up uh to the question beforehand. So how do you really enable the teams? Can you maybe take an example of um action points uh because I guess to go beyond just the um IT observability you're having more data which means you for sure have in those teams also more business team members or users. So how do you get them to be part of it? Okay. Um first step we are trying is to to make something like the nearest context. So guys from our IT department solutions we are using in the IT that's the first step that was the first step we already took. So one big solution we was in was the first integration as data source was MongoDB. So but MongoDB is really easy because MongoDB is used by our development team. So they already know which data is in that MongoDB. So that was a really easy easy step. But after that the teams is creating some dashboards and showing that dashboards to the business to the management and saying okay here on on that dashboard you can see how many new customers how good was that in that transformation or what else. So they are showing that dashboards to the management. This is the easy way on graphana you you have one big data base. you have one big place where you can include all data sources and you can use it from the technician to the management. So it was really easy to show that dashboards to the business to the management and after that the business was coming to us and say okay I'm interested in also see some SAP data near to my MongoDB data because we are selling machines for example and um I can see how many users are using or digital solutions but how many of that users also have shop some class machines for example and that wasn't and breaking point because after the business already have seen the management already have seen that dashboards they was something like interested in seeing more data and after that that was breaking change and the business and the management is coming to us and say okay I was really interested in see some informations from SAP I am interesting in seeing some informations for from a SQL database and then something like a self-running story the best of all that is you need some money only also for the in for the include for the PDC or something else. So it's some internal cost and if the business and the management comes to you and say okay I want to include that the money is saved. So if the developer is able to build good dashboards for the management and the management is using the graphana stack and using that dashboard something like switching in our company was the key successful for that. So we was not able to go to the business or to the management and say hey are you interested in normally they say no thanks I don't know what but after the developer was able to show something up some nice dashboards in that term one more question over here first of all thanks for the great insights uh I'd be interested to understand how come you chose Grafana cloud and um didn't go with the open source. Um, we used the graphana open source stack before. So if if you have seen my title, I'm coming from container technology from hosting Kubernetes and something like that and we was uh in the first um including or obsibility stack into that cubernetes cluster and there was more clusters. So we are using rancher as something like a single point of um contact for every developer all over our kubernetes clusters. So there was more kubernetes cluster coming on and coming on and coming on and on one point we say okay we need metrics in all our kubernetes clusters. So that was default. After some time our developer came and say okay we also need some blocks. And after a small time we have a big obsibility stack based on Grafana open source in every cubernetes cluster. And on one point you will see Grafana is really developing their products and we was in something like like time gap because we was not able to fulfill all that necessary patch management updates and so on and so on and so on and that was something like we where we said okay stop that that's not the way to go for us. And after that we took a look out in the market with some different vendors from the Gatnak quadrant. I I think everybody knows some Azure names and uh we chose Grafana cloud after that. So we started with open source and switched over to the Grafana cloud stack. Any question? Question from Busty. So maybe a really special question. Oh more questions. Yeah. Thanks for your talk over just one short question. Um after listening to the talk, do you think you can say Grafana helped you transforming your company into being more datadriven company than before by just giving access to the data even to management level? I I think it's a good question Basty. Um I think classes and company already was datadriven before um because you you use data nearly every place in your in or in your production. We are we are producing big machines with uh great techniques on board on that system for auto GPS navigation and some many other things and um that's all producing data. So I think we was already datadriven before we switched over to Grafana cloud. But yes, the Grafana cloud is an big option to visualize that data in a better way. All right. Thank you very much.
