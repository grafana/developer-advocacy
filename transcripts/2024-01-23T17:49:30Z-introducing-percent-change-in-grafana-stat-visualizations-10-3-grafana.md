Transcript: Hi, my name is Nathan Marrs and I'm the Tech
Lead of the DataViz Squad at Grafana Labs.  Today, I'm excited to announce you can now view
percent change in stat visualizations. This is a long standing community request
that enables you to visualize how your metrics are changing over time. To enable percent change in
your stat visualizations, head over to the Stats
Styles editor. Here, you'll find the option to toggle on
the percent change feature.  Now, let's talk about visual aesthetics. We understand the importance of
clarity in your visualizations, so we've incorporated color
indicators for percent change. If your stat visualization has no
background, color, or gradient, percent change will display as red or
green based on the sign of the value. This adds an extra layer
of visual information, making it easy to spot trends at a glance. We appreciate any feedback you
might have on this feature. Thanks from the DataViz Squad at Grafana.
