Transcript: hello graph Antics is your server performance data getting lost in Endless rows and colons making it hard to know how close you are to blowing out or running out of resources then grafana barage is here to save the day in today's video I will show you how to use this powerful tool to visualize critical metrics ensuring you stay within your desire ranges all depicted with elegant bars let's get started [Music] the grafana bar gauge panel let you easily visualize data ranges and thresholds using bars or sticks for each data element you query this powerful visualization offers many cool customizations you can change colors labels and ranges and even choose retro LCD Styles instead of regular bars it's an awesome tool for analyzing kpis performance and other metrics with important thresholds let's walk through the steps to create our first barage and then we will discuss the data needed to make it [Music] work we will use grafana plate to create our first barage panel but these steps work just as well in a local grafana setup to access grafana Play check the link in the corner grafana plays home screen is a dashboard follow these steps to add a new panel now in the panel editor set the visualization type to barage from the drop down in the top right corner and that's it you have your first barage panel well an empty panel but no worries we will work that in a bit but first in the main panel option section you can quickly modify the barage title description transparency links and repeat options for now we will just change the tit to my first barage sweet now back to this emptiness we need to set the right data we will be using the test data data source today for more information about it Link in the corner we will select the CSV file for the scenario and pick population by state as our data set finally you have your first and colorful bar gages but if those random numbers and bars don't make much sense or if you see a blank panel don't worry up next we will drive into the data needs and possibilities for the bar gauge panel to ensure that you are getting the most out of this visualization as mentioned earlier a bar gauge panel can paint a gauge for every series column or Row in your data it can visualize every cell in the table returned by your query to work with a barg visualization you need a data set quering at least one one numeric field and every numeric field in the data set will be displayed as a barage text or time fields are required but if they are present they are used for labeling to help you follow along I have provided a set of csvs in this video description okay let's start by copying the first one and pasting it into the test data data source CSV content section the pasted data has two rows three numeric columns and one Tex column wow pasting it makes a lot of colorful bar gauges to appear instantly for each column here you may notice a few things only the last row is displayed the text column is skipped and the column titles are automatically displayed why is that we will dive into the settings shortly to explain these behaviors meanwhile another cool feature is that the panel automatically sets the maximum and minimum values of the gauges based on the high and smallest number returned by your query now let's paste the next set of CSV values the just one set again available in the video description copying this set you will see only one barage it's cleaner and easier to read but it's empty well that is because it only has one value and remember the panel detects Max and minimum values from the query data you can Define them manually using a setting that we will explore in a moment next let's space the max mean included data set from the CSV again in the description below once pasted you get the value correctly displayed from the first gauge but you also see the Max and minimum values displayed not so cool right I don't want them there all these behaviors can be customized so why don't we dive into those settings and clear up common questions such as why we're only the last values displayed or where did the first ones go or how can you hide Max and minimum values and much more let's find out what these customizations are all [Music] about first let's copy and paste again the multi row and column data sets to explore up better all the options on the right side of the first item we have all the general panel options common to almost all panels in grafana for now I will just uh change again the title to uh gauging bars now in the value options the first option is the show it allows us to change between displaying calculated or all values so let's start with the easiest all values this tells the panel to display everything as you can tell the first row values have now appeared concatenated with the column name to distinguish them all we also have more options like the display limit in case you have too many bar gauges and under it you can indicate if you want to display all the numeric values in the query all the fields even if they are not gauge like text or to display only one field this is useful again if you have Fields def finding Max and minimum but only want to display the one with the value of Interest let's quickly bring back the Max minan uh data set and set the value nice okay now that we have hidden the Max and minimum let's go back to the multiple data to keep moving now going back the calculate show option let you do calculations by default you have last and that's why a moment ago we only saw the last one by default here you can select the first maximums averages and all sorts of calculations then similar to the old values you can Define what field to focus on moving on the bar gauge options customize some gauge display settings such as the orientation of the display which by default is automatic which does the same as vertical but if you select horizontal our values go from left to right cool I like vertical and it is the same as automatic but before we switch back we have the next setting the display mode this one is one of the coolest as you can change the bars from the original gradients to basic plain colored ones and LCDs I wanted to keep them horizontal as I think they look cooler when they are LCDs but now we can go back to automatic orientation and still cool LCDs I really like them but to make it easier in this video we will go back to gradient you can also modify the value displays from the default color text according to the barage thresholds plain or no values displayed well I like colors okay if you are in horizontal mode you can change the placement of the name of each field automatic or on top at the left of the bar gauges or not to display them if you are vertically displaying bars you can only hide or show the names under the bars if you have gradient or basic for the display mode you can make the bars consume the whole Space which is by default or move the numbers to where the bar appears and the last option is to change the bar sizes affecting their height and width if horizontal and only width if vertical now in the Legion section you can add a legion to the bars that is a text that appears below the visualization you can have it as a list or as a table place it below the bars or on the right side change the width and select the values or calculations that you wish to display let's just deactivate them the next settings are the text size which is straightforward you can affect the text size of the title on the bars and the values on top of them again straightforward personally I like them automatic so we should let grafana do the work right now in the standard options you can change things like the unit of the value being miles or kilometers or temperature or whatever we have as well the minimum and maximum values here in case you don't have them uh or want to pull them from the query data you can Define them here hardcoded again leave them empty if you want them to automatically be defined from the values returned by your query speaking of automatic if you have a list of values per field you can also turn the field into calculation to pull them from each field set of values or columns and not the whole returns table lastly you can set things like the number of decimals that you want the title displayed under the gauge the color scheme and what to display when there are no values and speaking of the color scheme barage colors displayed depend on the thresholds that you define in the last tab of the settings and that is the barug visualization clicking apply adds your barage panel you can resize it in your dashboard or add other types of panels if you want to learn more about other panels check the videos on the screen but today you became an expert creating beautifully straight gauges happy dashboarding and have a good one
