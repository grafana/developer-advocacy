# OpenTelemetry and Grafana Community Call Transcript

**Moderator:**  
Hi everyone, we are live with the first OpenTelemetry and Grafana community call. This is the first one in a series where we will cover all the different topics powered by OpenTelemetry and how they show up in Grafana, including Grafana Cloud and OSS. We have a few people here who work on different experiences. I'm Ludmila Malova, and a big part of my job involves OpenTelemetry and everything around it. 

We have Nicole, who is a Developer Advocate at Grafana, working on OpenTelemetry and more. Our guest today is Merilia Gutierrez. She will talk about declarative configuration in OpenTelemetry and the upcoming GC elections and community work she is driving. 

Hi everybody! If you have any questions, please send them in the comments, and we will be happy to answer. I‚Äôm going to hand it over to Nicole.

**Nicole:**  
Hi everyone! I wanted to let everybody know about this new awesome series that Ludmila and I are starting. The premise is that Ludmila comes on as the expert in OpenTelemetry, while I get to be the beginner asking beginner questions, so everyone gets to learn while I learn. 

I have an announcement! Recently, we had the OBSCon, and the OBS Observability Con keynote is on YouTube right now. I just put that in the comments, and it's also in the description. It's a good summary of everything that was announced at OBSCon. If you haven't already watched it, it's free on YouTube, so be sure to check that out. 

Today, we‚Äôre super excited to have Merilia Gutierrez with us. Merilia, could you kick us off by talking a little bit about yourself and how you got into OpenTelemetry?

**Merilia:**  
Oh, you're muted. Sorry! Hi everyone! My name is Merilia. I work at Grafana as a software developer, and I also work a lot in OpenTelemetry. We have a lot of things happening in OpenTelemetry, and Grafana really loves OpenTelemetry. 

**Nicole:**  
Wonderful! So, how did you start working in OpenTelemetry?

**Merilia:**  
Well, I started working as an end user. I really liked the area of observability and decided I wanted to focus on it. So, I was looking for a new job that would allow me to fully engage in this field. When I got the opportunity to be a contributor in OpenTelemetry, I realized it was perfect for me. Since then, I have been working on various aspects and continually find new things to focus on. 

**Nicole:**  
That‚Äôs the danger of open source‚Äîit keeps you busy! There is an endless amount of work.

**Merilia:**  
Exactly! The challenge with OpenTelemetry, particularly, is also its strength‚Äîthere‚Äôs always something happening and so many areas to focus on, which can be daunting for newcomers. When trying to figure out how to instrument an application, it can feel overwhelming with all the different considerations. However, that‚Äôs why we need declarative configuration to streamline the process, right?

**Merilia:**  
Yes, this project has been in development for several months, and many people are contributing to it. Currently, Java is in a good place, with many features already implemented. We also have work being done for JavaScript, PHP, Go, and Python, and the hope is to have this compatible across all languages.

**Nicole:**  
That‚Äôs great to hear! Do you have some slides you‚Äôd like to share with us?

**Merilia:**  
Yes, let me share my screen. Before I dive into the CI configuration, I want to introduce the areas I touch upon. As I mentioned, I‚Äôm part of the OpenTelemetry SDK team at Grafana. I also maintain the contributor experience group. If you want to be a contributor and are having issues, that‚Äôs the group that can help. We also have a new channel called OpenTelemetry New Contributor on the CNCF Slack to get assistance.

Previously, configurations were mostly done using environment variables because they are easy to understand and universally available. However, we now need more advanced settings, which requires a more robust solution. This is where declarative configuration comes into play, allowing us to shift away from environment variables.

**Nicole:**  
Just to clarify, does that mean we can still use existing environment variables, but no new ones will be created?

**Merilia:**  
Exactly! Existing environment variables can still be used, but no new ones will be added. The goal is to allow advanced configurations through the YAML file instead. 

**Nicole:**  
That sounds like a great improvement! 

**Merilia:**  
Yes, the configuration file is a YAML file, which is robust and easier to visualize. You can set all your required values in a hierarchical manner. You can still use environment variables, but now you can configure things in a more straightforward way. 

Here‚Äôs an example configuration file. As you can see, it allows for more complex setups and is much easier to manage than multiple environment variables.

**Nicole:**  
Awesome! 

**Merilia:**  
I'll also mention that we just published a blog post on this topic, highlighting examples and the current state in Java. 

**Nicole:**  
Great! I think everyone should check that out. 

**Merilia:**  
Now, I‚Äôm going to stop sharing and hand it over to Ludmila for a demo.

**Ludmila:**  
Thank you, Merilia! I‚Äôm going to show how declarative config makes life easier. We‚Äôll look at a simple Java application that sends two HTTP requests to example.com‚Äîone with GET and another with OPTIONS. 

Using the Java agent, we instrument this application to enable telemetry. By utilizing the configuration, we can customize the behavior, such as dropping certain spans based on attributes. This is something that would have been complicated to achieve with environment variables alone.

**Nicole:**  
Merilia, I have some questions for you while Ludmila is setting that up. 

So, from what I understand, declarative config is separate from the collector‚Äôs config, right?

**Merilia:**  
Yes, they are distinct components. The SDK config deals with instrumentation configuration within the application, while the collector focuses on batch high-throughput scenarios.

**Nicole:**  
And the declarative configuration only changes the configuration part, right? You still need to instrument your application in code.

**Merilia:**  
Exactly! While declarative config provides options for instrumentation configuration, it does not replace the need to instrument your code.

**Nicole:**  
Got it. And if someone removes a component from the config, like the meter provider, will it disable metrics?

**Merilia:**  
For the meter provider, there are defaults in place, so it would still function, but you could disable it through the config if necessary.

**Nicole:**  
Thank you! That clarifies things. And for those watching, if you have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments!

**Merilia:**  
Yes, and definitely check out the resources we shared. If you want to contribute to OpenTelemetry, join us on Slack or check out the SIGs. We welcome all contributions!

**Nicole:**  
Great! Thank you, Merilia, for all your insights. Remember to vote for Merilia and Ted Young in the upcoming GC elections!

**Merilia:**  
Thank you! I‚Äôm excited to see how we can all contribute to making OpenTelemetry even better.

**Nicole:**  
That‚Äôs a wrap for today‚Äôs community call. Thanks everyone for joining us! Have a great day!

Hi everyone, we are live with the first open telemetry and graphana community call. This is the first one in series. would like to cover uh all the different topics uh things that are powered in open powered by open telemetry and how they show up in graphana how they show up in graphana cloud in OSS and here uh we have a few people that who work on all the different experiences I'm Ludmila Malova I'm big part of my job is up in telemetry and everything around it um we have Nicole She is a developer advocate at Graphana working on open telemetry unlock and Morelia she's our guest today she's going to talk about declarative configuration in open telemetry and also about upcoming GC elections and the community work uh she is driving with this um hi everybody if you have any questions please send them uh to the comments we will be happy to answer. Um, and I'm going to hand it over to uh Nicole. Yeah. Hi everyone. I I'm Nicole. I um I just wanted to to let everybody know about this new awesome series that Lead Miller and I are starting. So, the premise is that Lead Miller comes on as the expert in OTEL and I get to be the beginner asking the beginner questions. So everyone gets to learn while I learn. And I have there's an announcement to recently we had OBSC con and the OBS observability con keynote is on YouTube right now. So I've just put that in the comments and it's also in the description. Uh this is this is like a a good summary of everything that was that was announced at OBSCON. So, if you haven't already watched it, it's just free on YouTube um to watch that. No sign up necessary. So, make sure to check that out. And today, we're super excited to have Melia Gutierrez with us over there. And Merilia, maybe you could kick us off and talk a little bit about yourself and who you are and how you got into open telemetry in the first place. Oh, you're muted. Hey, that should be like on a bingo screen. I'm muted. Sorry. Hi everyone. My name is Bida. I work at Graphana. Uh I'm a software developer here and I also work a lot in open telemetry. So we have a lot of things happening on open telemetry and graphana really loves open telemetry. So I'm hoping to talk about Wonderful. So, how did you start working in open up telemetry earlier? >> So, let me just check one thing because I'm I'm hearing myself. >> Oh, that's so super distracting. >> Okay. So, basically I I started working as an end user. uh and then I really like this area of like observability. I was like, "Oh, that is an area that you want to continue to focus on." So then I was for new job. No, I want something that that is that I want to be basically that would be like my full-time job. And then when I got this opportunity, I found out that it's your job is to be a contributor telemetry. Like that is perfect. That is what I wanted. And then when I started working on different things, I just keep finding more and more things to work on. And then I just like, oh, now I like this thing and I want to work on that. Oh, now I like this thing and I like to work on that, too. So, it's pretty much now I just keep finding more things and I have like montaneous status and approver here and there. I just keep adding more things for me to do. >> Yeah, that's the danger of open source. It keeps you tight. It never ends. There is an endless amount of work. >> Well, it's great to have you here. >> Yeah. And like I think the problem with open telemetry in particular is also its strength that you're talking about. There's always something that's happening and there's so many things that you could focus on, but it can be pretty daunting when you're just beginning. um with open telemetry in particular, you're trying to figure out how to when I try to figure out how to instrument an application like I it seems like there are so many things that I have to take into account and then now apparently that's changing as well. That setup it feels like is is always progressing which is good. It's always getting easier but it can seem a little disjointed and then different languages have different processes and you know why why I guess that's also why we need something like declarative configuration to streamline that process right >> yeah so that is a project that has been happening for several months now and is a lot of people working on it and now is on a basically on a state that we have for example Java is in a really good place uh is is working a lot for it has a lot of like the features already uh is fully compatible a few features still missing when we say like fully compatible we still have more things to work on it but we also have other that working on the JavaScript one so uh I'm making adding like more and more features there and also also have for PHP, Go, Python. There's like things happening on all of them. So, the hope is to have this compatible with all. >> Well, I know you have some slides you wanted to take us through. So, do you want to go through that? And also for everybody watching, really said that she's totally okay if people like interrupt to ask questions and stuff. So, you can just leave that in the comments and we'll get we'll make sure that they get answered. >> Okay, you're muted again, but you're good to go, Merilia. Otherwise, >> yeah, >> these it's AirPods. When you touch them, sometimes they decide to mute. >> Yeah. So, okay, I'm I'm good now. So, let's talk about a little about the CI config. Before I want to actually give a little introduction of all the areas that I do touch. Uh so I am as I mentioned at Graphana my team is the open telemetry SDK team. So that is my mostly my focus working on in hotel but in hotel I'm working on a couple of different groups. So I am a maintainer for the contributor experience. So if you are someone that wants to be a contributor and you are having some issues that is the group that we can help you with. And by the way, we have a new channel that is hotel new contributor. So you can go to that one on the CNCF Slack to get some help. Uh I also am an approver for the JavaScript SDK, the Portuguese localization, database semantic conventions and as of a few days ago also for the communication one. So you can see that I just I am all over. So let me give a little context about a configuration. So before was things were mostly done using environment variables and why that was done was mostly because it's very easy to understand environment variables and it's just something that is universally available. So doesn't matter like the language you have at least some version of it might have like slightly difference here and there but it's very easy to like create the same name that everybody can use and that works great for what we have so far. But the problem now we want really advanced configuration and so we need something complex that can handle this. So we need also something more robust. So there cames the idea of declared configuration and to make that possible we are now disallowing any new environment variables otherwise we're going to be on this constant like catching up of like adding things there but things still getting added to the environment variable. So, uh, we're putting like a pause on environment barrels and basically making things work for the configurations. So, I have a question on that front. Yeah. >> So, you said no new ones. You said you're putting a pause on it. Does that mean So, I I assume that means we can still use environment variables now, right? But does that mean they will eventually be deprecated or we're just going to stop development on them? So the idea is that the things that we are using can going to be able to continue working. It's just that no new environment variables should be created. So h everything that you have so far we are not stopping any that and even I'm going to show like even here we saw on this slides that you can still use environment variable on your config file. So the things that exist so far they're not like going away. We keep them. It's just nothing new is getting added. >> Okay, got it. Thanks. >> Yeah, so now with the config file, basically it works is a YAML file pretty much. uh and then is a little more robust, is easier to expand, a little easier to also like visualize because before imagine that you want set up a specific like end points to your tracer and then like okay how do you pass all the values that you want to like your trace exporter. You have to like okay this environment variable for this and this for the other but now you just put it on your emote act as an object and put all the things with the right hierarchy. So it works that way and as I mentioned you can still use environment variable. So here is the example of when you put the value would be like the equal it would be like this part saying like hey check if I have this environment variable set up if I don't have use this value instead. So for example, here are the end points otherwise just lose local host. And how do you actually say like I want to use the file? Well, I see the irony on this, but is set up an environment variable to say that you want to use a file. I do see the irony here, but it's pretty much that is when you say like when what the SDKs now are implementing is that basically they check this environment variable. So if you have a file and is a valid file, it's going to use that and ignore your environment variables. So it's a one or the other. It's not something like it's going to get a couple of the file and a couple of the of the environment variable. It's one or the other. So if it checks on that you have a file and is it valid, it's going to use those. If there are some parameters that you don't have on your config file, there are a few of them that do have the default values. So those are the ones that are getting set up and if you don't have a few of them just say like if you don't set up here it's just like a no or like undefined like you just don't set up that particular value. Uh but that is kind of the idea. I I put a like an example that you can basically see how it looks like. This is a very like basic one. Uh we have the the format on top and here like some resources here an example like tracer provider, beta provider and logger provider. A very basic one just saying like this is the endpoint that I want to send. So now you you have an idea of how it looks like and the you can really do more complex things here which is the next one that I want to show which this one is an issue that was open like on the Java report five years ago that was just saying I just want to filter out health checks I don't want to be sending traces for them like I don't care doesn't make sense why I'm like consuming resources to be sending this and it was No easy way to do this. But now with the configure file, you can because on your file you can say like my tracer provider I want a sampler here. You can see like the rules I want to drop the when this attribute matches this pattern. So it's now a little more straightforward that you can just say like here follow this. Now imagine doing this when environment variables how how do you like do this is there's no easy way or you have to like maybe manually you go to the instrumentation and you create your sampler and things like that that is the other option but again it's a lot of work for you if you can just like say this is what I want and whoever is instrumenting the SDKs is the one handling that is a lot easier for you for the end user and we are the the one developing we have to worry so you don't have to worry And then here another example you can see like there's a lot of information we can put there. So processor like the back. >> I also wanted to say that um Marilia has a blog post that that she wrote with a few other people on this topic and I just put the link in the comments as well if you want to check that out and in the description. >> Awesome. >> Sorry. >> No, not at all. Yeah, we just posted like this week uh talking about because uh I mention like it's a very recent thing and in Java is now like working and it was a release done on Friday. So it's a very fresh thing here. Uh so yeah actually we're going to go to a demo right now. I'm going to stop sharing and then Luda will do a little demo for you guys. >> Yeah, thank you for the intro. Uh so the thing I'm going to show is basically reinforcing your words about how declarative config makes life easier. And we are going to take a look at a very trivial application. It doesn't do anything interesting. It sends two HTTP requests to example.com. One with get optit and another one with options. And maybe options requests are not interesting and you want to drop them. So there is nothing interesting from upper telemetry standpoint in this application. There is just one thing that wraps this main method uh into a span. Um and the all the interesting things happen in how when when we run this application. So what do how do we do this? Uh this is Java and Java has a nice feature of Java engine. That's something that is able to intercept when application starts and actually instrument it. So we are instrumenting this application with Java agent and it will enable a bunch of instrumentation libraries. It would also configure up and telemetry SDK to report this telemetry from instrumentations to the back end. Here we use config, right? Imagine we didn't have it. it would still configure some defaults uh like OTLP endpoint and things. Uh with config we can actually override this defaults and um also some interesting behavior. Let's take a look at the config. So it's pretty much the same what Marelia showed you in the slides. Um and we have tracer provider, meter provider and logger provider. Here we set service name. Um and we can enable a bunch of things. The all the interesting stuff happens here. We customize the sampler and imagine like if we used environment variables or uh system Java system properties to do it we would only be able to configure different type of sampler like always on always on probability but here the behavior is kind of complicated. We say okay there is a fallback and it's always on and we are going to drop certain spans client spans with this attribute uh with that matches this value right uh so there is not much interesting that happens if we run this example uh it will do the requests it will report telemetry see it made a couple of HTTP requests if we Now uh look um at the um my local uh LGTM stack. I have uh tempo running here. We'll just check spans uh for uh for brevity. Okay, we what do we have here? We have a span from app declarative config. This is the main span. And we see get request. we don't see options right so this this uh what happened was uh declarative config imagine we didn't have it right so I have an example of another application it's actually exactly the same application the only difference is how we enable upon telemetry here uh we still have Java agent we provide service name we system property. We could have done it through environment variable uh and we provide a thing called extension. This is Java specific thing. It might not exist in other languages. There is a pretty advanced extensibility point. And the point is that uh in order to customize this complicated behavior of picking a custom sampler, we need to develop our own library. We need to maintain it. We need to deploy it along with our application. And uh it took me well. It's embarrassing. Took me embarrassingly long to write this code. Uh so it enables programmatic configuration of this one specific component uh the rulebased sampler. It's configured in the same way as declarative config. It's actually the same implementation. It's just the programmatic interface of it. But I need to register something called customizer provider. And uh it's kind of difficult to discover and it's a lot of moving pieces. And the last but not the least if you want to see what uh declarative config hides from you uh well declarative config along with other uh parts of Java agent is here is a small part of programmatic configuration boiler plate you would write if you were to do it all yourself and it just configures tracing and uh still uses a bunch of defaults. >> Okay, so this is the demo. I have some questions for Marelia about the config. >> I have a question. Wait, can I ask you some questions while you you have this up and running? Um let me try and see if I can if I can summarize this and maybe that both of you could correct me if if I've understood something wrong. Um so from what I understand declarative config does not so there are two things when when I heard about declarative config I thought they were talking about declarative config for the hotel collector which we already have but this is separate right yeah the uh SDK config uh well there are some parts that may look and feel similar to the collector but there are two distinct things and the components we configure it pretty much uh different right so in SDK we are interested about instrumentation configuration something within the application that has let's say access to uh local information the collector is uh focused on this batch high throughput production scenarios and it's slightly different ideally in the future maybe we will have more intersection and more commonalities But uh they will never be exactly the same. >> Okay. And then the second thing is that um when you when you're instrumenting your application first there's the actual instrumentation part where you're doing it in code like you still have to import libraries from hotel and stuff but then there's the configuration part uh where you're setting um where you have different options and settings where you can change the endpoint and and all that. So declarative configuration only changes that part, right? You still need to instrument your code somehow. It doesn't it doesn't magically do that, right? >> Yeah, that's right. But they kind of go hand to hand. So uh declarative config can provide configuration for instrumentation and can say okay disable it. So some other part like if you use let's say java agent or some other open telemetry distro that brings instrumentation libraries this component usually enables both declarative configuration and a bunch of instrumentation libraries. uh you can control the instrumentation behavior through declarative config but the declarative config does not produce telemetry out of the near it's only tells how this telemetry should be collected and reported. Yeah, as you saw like Yeah. So as you saw like the example like the Miller was showing like at that point that like she created all the tracer and then I had to put a lot of like this is the span all those lines for example you wouldn't have to create this manually with the CR config because we already seen like these are the values now the SDK you go and implement this for me. So there is a mix that you can like skip a several things because the SDK is handling for you. You still have the option of do things manually if you want and also on the the clarity config we can kind of like separate in two areas I would say the file. So one I would say like the general that is language agnostic. So that is like a really cool thing because the same file it would work if you have Java, if you have JavaScript, if you have Python. So is the exact same file for all the SDKs and then you have a session that is specific for language because there are a few cases that this particular config only exists for the Java agent. So doesn't make sense to add to the others. So you do also have a part there that is like okay Java this like JavaScript this and things like that. So you can still use the same file for everybody which I think is something that is really helpful. >> Yeah, that's such a good point that it's cross language because with YAML you don't have to worry if it you know because I' I've done this. I've tried to instrument a Java app and then a Python app. I'm like it's different. I have to I have to remember what it is for Java. And I think Lud Miller, you said that autoconfigure is only a Java thing, not it doesn't exist for Python. So just things like that that I'm like I don't want to have to remember this stuff. >> Yes. Yeah, that is the goal. Even like for now the one thing that we want to really help out even like as as Grafana is be able to just show you a file like this is a file that you get what you want uh at least the very like basic all you want and then you can customize on on top of that but then you'll know that it's going to work no matter what is your application your level and things like that. So I think that is like the really cool thing about this. >> Yeah. And also because it seemed like it seems like the the part that the declarative config replaces is all like boilerplate stuff anyway, you know, when I when I do this from when I do this again from scratch, I just like copy paste this whole chunk of text, you know, but because I I don't know. It's not I know you said it's it's really good for advanced cases, but I think it's also good for beginner cases because I know all of the settings that you can change or should change. I just want like best practices. Just just give it to me. Like I don't I don't want to have to tweak a whole bunch of things. >> Yeah. And one thing that I find also really cool is that for example right now you're going to instrument your application for you to know all the possible configuration that you can do is so hard for you to find like what is even possible today like I I don't know is you're going to have to look at every single documentation for each type of process or components on different languages. But now you have every single configuration in the same place. And there is even on the repo that is about configuration. There is a file that I'm going to share also like that is called like kitchen sync which is a great example for you to look which pretty much just say every time that we created a spec for something that should that could exist on the config an example of it is added to this file and it has like the value and an actual the description of what it is and the default value if you don't put this one. So if you just want to see what is possible check that file that is called kitchen sync that you have everything there and then the same place we have one that is migration that is today you use the environment variables and you want to start using the config file but you don't know like oh do I need to now go and set up what I need to do so we have an example that actually points to your environment variable so this is a way for you to do the transition Also, without having to think too much why you need, we have like some boiler plate, there are things that you're going to need it. >> Yeah. One thing I really love about the hiding the boiler plate that when I look into the into the config, it actually explains me the magic behind open telemetry dro tells me, oh, this is my configuration. This is how the tracer provider is configured. I'm curious what what happens if I remove something. Let's say I remove meter provider. Does it mean my metrics will be disabled or will uh they be enabled with some defaults? Do you know? So the for the meter provider there is some default for it. So a lot of the cases might have like because I know the endpoint has the default. So it might not fill all the other parameters but it does have uh boate for all the providers >> right and then they probably can disable uh let's say metrics if I don't want them >> correct >> through the config. Yeah, wonderful. So, what happens if you mentioned this briefly, but I don't know if I understood it correctly. If you have something in the config, but then you for some reason also set an environment variable like, you know, maybe it's a theme, you know, people haven't gotten the memo that they they're changing over, maybe they still ran it with all the environment variables. Did you say that the the YAML config will override the environment variables if if there is a conflict? >> So not override, they would like take precedence. So they will look at the file first and if the file exists, it only going to look at the file. It's not going to look at the environment variables at all. If the file does not exist, then it's going to look at the envir variables. So there is no like combination of the two or is one or the other. So what you can do is have environment variables on your config file but it's not like you are looking at the the file and some of the attributes are not there then is going to try to look at the environment. No, that is not the case. It's just one or the other >> and you can use placeholders for your environment variables. So somebody who migrates you from uh environment variables to the config, they can create a config file that would take environment variables and use them uh in the config. >> Oh, I see. So that's probably that's a good that's a good thing to call out. That is probably how people should migrate. And I think example >> yeah I just added that to I put the link to it in the chat. >> Yeah. So if you want to I I'm sharing now if you want to put it up I can go. So this is the example that I mentioned. So you see here like SDK migration config. Uh and you can see here let me show like for example here is this one saying like hey I'm checking the environment variable and if that does not exist I'm using false or like value the same thing like for service name I'm trying to check the environment variable otherwise I use a known service. So this is something that does work that this is like the example for the migration that are the basic things that we're expecting. So we have like some propagator like trace provider and you can see here like all the values we have default for all of them. So that is kind of like the idea you can still use it here. So which languages is this available for? It seemed like Java and maybe PHP. >> So here is a compliance matrix that we have today. So if you see here uh Java is fully compliant with all the basic requirements for this uh P ph PHP as well uh JavaScript is the one that I am actually working on it. So it is getting more more pluses are getting added to those. >> So what you're saying is it's your favorite. >> Yeah, I'm the one working on JavaScript. So I was like yes. But yeah, we have like awesome people working on all the others as well. uh and as I mentioned like for example if you see here Java you see the pluses all around does not mean that it's complete the there are still features missing uh but at least all the the requirements here that we say that is actually compliant with config file are available so in Java you can already use uh PHP you can also use I think there's also few features uh missing uh I know there is also for go and I believe Python. So for Go there are things but uh we just need to update the actual documentation to show how you can actually use it and that's kind of yeah for the JavaScript is not ready to use that yet is doing like all the parsing and preparing like the config model itself. Uh but now I am at the point that I'm actually using all of those config models to the actual SDK. >> Nice. Is it in development or is it stable? What is the status of the configuration story? >> So right now is uh release candidate 2. So hopefully very soon we'll be marked as stable. Uh so that is the plan. Hopefully you know following weeks we will be have some official stabilization of it and also there is something if you're listening in and you still have some feedback that this is your chance you can start using for example you can use the Java one that is uh already is ready to use so you can provide some feedback anything that might be missing that is your chance so we can add that to the actual spec and that before we mark as a stable I cannot wait for the declarative config to come to Python. It would save people from writing so much boilerplate code. >> You know, if you say that too loudly, Lud Mill, someone will just say like, well, why don't you contribute it? I the thought had crossed my mind, too, but I wasn't going to say it out loud. >> I'm I'm thinking about it. >> Okay. Okay. Well, maybe maybe I can think about it with you in private. >> Anyone from the audience? Anyone? Python, any fans? >> Yeah. I mean, I think that's the open telemetry thing when people say like how can we contribute and there's like all of these languages, all of these features need to be done. >> Yeah. and even like some of the six uh sik just for in case you don't know means special interest group. So this is kind like how we group is almost like a onetoone like each repo is a sick not exactly but some cases may vary but you can think like this way. Uh some of them are really needing more people to contribute. So if that is something that you're interested I know that sometimes could be like oh I heard about collector so I want to go to the collector but there's a lot of people already helping the collector and there are a few smaller sigs that really need the help uh so try to join those ones and you're going to have a really big impact on them. So you're you're talking you're splitting it up here based on languages, but like just based on features, is there anything that you you particularly would like to take declarative config and or what you would like to see from declarative config in the future? Yeah, I think it's just like this idea of being easy to use that you don't have to like when you create like your instrumentation file, you have to be the one like setting up everything like oh no, I need this component with this value and then you forget about one. No, I want to have like a single place. I just put the config there. Everything is like there. I don't have to go to different files and different environment variables and then I want to have everything just configured at in that place. >> Yeah, >> I was wondering too when I learned about this that maybe it it's also kind of a cultural shift, right? Because when everything is in the code that's a developer problem or I don't want to say problem but like you know developers have that happy responsibility of of having to instrument everything and configure everything and having it in a YAML file means that um it it is shifting more towards the ops side. Do you think that that reflects a cultural sh change in responsibility for observability or or it's just making it accessible for everyone? What do you think about that? >> Yeah, I think exactly making accessible to everyone because it's a language that both sides can understand. Uh so it's something that now is like the developers will be able to like communicate with the ops and vice versa. they can say like oh these are the things like for example I want you to send to this location like this is the endpoint that we should be using like I don't know how the information like the telemetry is going to arrive there but that is the value that I wanted to send and then the development team like can just like confirm and then run this use this config file to set things up. So it kind of like almost becomes like a bridge between those two teams because now is like that common language that that both sides can can understand and I think it opens more doors for things like remote configuration or dynamic configuration where you would be maybe hopefully one day push a change the ops team would be able to push a change and let's say reduce uh the sampling rate or turn on some new instrumentation uh that was off by default for specific investigation and then uh developers don't need to go and uh write this feature right it's just a part of remote configuration push which sounds scary but also exciting >> yeah I can imagine like you are just handling an on call and you as just go to this file now say like okay now add the type to like debug instead of just info and you don't have to talk about the team to deploy and like change this all the code. No, it's just there you're accessible and then restart and you can see the things that you need. >> Okay. Can you can you explain a little bit more about remote configuration and dynamic configuration? I think I understand but maybe I think I need more clarity. >> Yeah. So for example uh the log level Marilia gave is awesome. Um normally you would deploy the production with default log level like warning right so you are not overwhelmed with all the logs but imagine something goes wrong and you see errors related uh to certain area I don't know network connection uh and you would want to enable more login for this specific area so that you can see why this errors are occuring what else in the logs and In a perfect world, my ops uh team or me being in a devops uh could uh say, "Oh, okay, let's enable this specific login logger uh with info level or debug level." uh and then if this configuration file uh can be redeployed and reread or if it's part of some protocol between let's say graphana cloud or another back end and your application then you push this configuration change and application uh is picking up this configuration and now uh instead of recording just warning logs it records more verbal cause information and then you can turn it off so you don't overwhelm your back end. Okay. So um when you so that that is remote configuration, right? But but it is also dynamic configuration because it's doing it on the fly. Is it is dynamic configuration the same as live configuration? >> Yeah, probably. Uh I don't know. But we're talking about dreams, right? It's the things that might eventually happen. >> Yeah. The dream is just like make one change on the line and is already picking up and Yeah. >> Well, YAML is definitely a step towards that. Like it brings it closer to the whole GitHops ideal like utopia of just one little change in a YAML file that's pushed to GitHub changes everything and redeploys. But now it's like, oh, maybe you don't even have to redeploy. Maybe maybe it's already it doesn't need the restart. That would be awesome. That's a great dream to have. Was there anything else that you can think of, Aurelia, that that you would like to see or that has already been discussed about um adding to the the declarative config? I think yeah that just now is the is the dream of just making that change and instantly gets applied everywhere. >> Yeah. Well, you also have some things here uh some resources I think to get started. >> Yeah. So those are the first one is the blog post that we just published me and two other colleagues from my team Gregor andJ the about the declar showing a few examples how to work on on Java and just current states in general. Uh then I put here the repo of the actual configuration if you want to check what is the actual spec and then the two examples that I mentioned. So the ka tank the migration one and if you have questions if you have your question is general about the file you can go to the hotel config file on the CSCF slack h if your question is specific to your SDK like oh how do I really initialize this JavaScript on Java then you can go to the direct sik so that would be like the hotel Java hotel JavaScript and so on. >> So, can you tell us >> Yeah, go ahead. >> Yeah, I was going to jump into the contribution story like and ask Marelia how was how did it the project this big uh come to fruition? >> Yeah. So that is one even like that we mentioned on the blog post it started like five years ago and it was like how we can filter health checks and so that is something that is also really cool about open telemetry is that like not necessarily want to say okay we can figure out a way to filter for your specific cases do this hacky thing and then we create this component and that's it or we can actually have something more robust and say like okay let's really think about this go step by step have a working group thinking about this specific problem get feedback from people have proof of concepts and that of course this is why things like that take time similar thing that happened with the database semantic conventions that I work with with mil on it so that are just things that take time to make sure that we hear uh end users that we hear people that are actually going to use and what makes sense for everybody. What things that should exist and with this is something that is a long project and a lot of people contribute to and it's something that also get involved. So might have a couple people that started and then they had to like move on to something else. Then another people come in and pick up and continue and now is on this state like okay it's becoming stable but we need more people implementing on different SDKs. So that is something like for example that I jump in and like okay I'm gonna instrument this on JavaScript and we have people in other languages. So it's a very something that is a collaboration amongst a lot of people just handling different parts of this project so we can like all come together and just make it easier for everybody. It's always a difficult thing, right, when in open source because it's great that there are so many minds that can be working on something and it it there's a lot of like community spirit because people aren't doing this for money except for the few who are lucky who are who are paid to contribute to open source. But it is still a challenge when people are all getting together and they're from different companies with maybe sometimes competing agendas or you know you're trying to coordinate this massive effort and that's where uh some sort of leadership is necessary for hotel. >> Yeah. So that is something that we want to always strive to have this to be like for example vendor neutral. So we don't want to have anything like oh let's do this way because it works this way with my vendor. That is something that we are really mindful about it. Uh of course we might hear opinions on different people just to see like what makes sense since people are using those back ends. Uh but again as you mentioned like Alise I'm very lucky that my full-time job is working on this open source project. So at the same time I'm very mindful of people that I know that I sometimes work with people that are doing this on their time off time or doing like on the weekends. So I'm not going to like say like no you have I want this feature and you have to work on this. Of course not. So but that is something that at the same time we see a lot of people contributing together and we do have uh different groups. The one is called like the technical committee that will help when there is like decisions that need to be made on a technical level and we also have the governance committee that it it is a group making sure that the health of the the project in general is in a good place. what are the road map priorities and just how we can help the project in general. >> So in this case like the governance committee would be would do something like would you would you be involved in making sure that uh the other languages also eventually go in this direction at least of declarative configuration and YAML filebased configuration rather than environment variables. Is that the sort of thing that you that you would do? >> So the governance committees like each of the six have their own collected liaison. So one GC member is responsible for each one. So those things can be brought by the GC at the same time each se has their own autonomy. We also don't want the like the GC be like micromanaging and say like you have to do this at this time because we know that might have different priorities. So it is a thing that each group has their own autonomy to do what their thing but they also have the support and basically the backup of the GC whenever they need help and at the same time things like the the group can say like hey I think we are hitting a lot of feedback that for example the graphical config is something that a lot of people are interested in so I think that is something that you should be paying attention to and look so it can provide also guidance on that level as well. >> Yeah, the GC work is very hard. It's like hurting cats, but it's a very special cats. They don't even they are not even interested in food or anything. Uh you you don't necessarily know and you need to like build this uh energy around the community. So people would start to contribute to something in common otherwise it would be a patchwork of small different features here and there. So the GC elections are coming next week, right? >> Yes. >> And you are participating. You Velia, you are one of the candidates. >> Uh what brought you here? Why do you want to be part of GC doing all this difficult work? Yeah, I that is something that I I'm just because I I like this part of figuring out like what we can help how we can organize uh and even like things as a a like the contributor experience is that something that was like okay how we can actually help everybody to be contributor and then with this I started actually joining several six just to like listen in and you hear some pain points on different places. So you just keep having like ideas of like how I can help. I want to be able to do this for this group and I want to be able to do this for that group. So it's just having this this level that I will I really want to help out other teams to have like a good place to have a healthy level of like new contributors and they didn't know what to do and at the same time being able to actually align different SDKs and I know we have like different priorities for like for example people really want logs to be stable and has been in development for I don't know how long. So it's just a little improving. I want to focus on it on improving the communication with the end user and the people that are actually developing. Uh so that is something that got interested in me and just because I mentioned that I'm lucky that I can actually have the time to focus on that. So because it's actually my job, I don't have to like divide with something else. I think I can bring this also like a new view to the team. Uh it's also good to have like fresh ideas and circle a little the the people that are working on something. So I think that is kind of just bringing a new perspective as well. I'm glad you mentioned logs because in the Python s like the for Python um the metrics and traces are are well supported but like logs are still you know kind of sketchy and and yeah that is something that I would love to see improve. Um, so you you I think make raise a good point that that you are also like this is your job. You have the time to to be able to focus on these things and we're super lucky that that we all are are paid by Graphana to to work on open source projects. How awesome is that? And they also wanted to call out another of our co-workers who who is also up for reelection this term this month and that's Ted Young. Oh yeah. So here's here's the slide for the for how to vote. The this starts next week, October 27, and it's confusing about the time like leader and I were going over it trying to translate it into UTC and it's confusing, but it's on October 27 for sure. No. Yes. Because we do the everywhere on Earth time. Uh what it does. So that means wherever you are from the 27 until the 29 like midnight your time you so we have like three three days for for voting. So it's from Monday to Wednesday is the election. So if you are a contributor to open telemetry you are ellegible to vote and then you can vote here. You can see the link for the vote here that right now you can log in but it's not going to show anything because it's not yet up. But then next Monday you will be able to see the the candidates. >> How would somebody know if they are eligible? >> So the the second link uh that was shared there is an issue that lists everybody that uh is eligible to votes. If you are somebody that So one thing that is a challenge here is that this is counting people that contributed to any of the repos but you might be somebody that doesn't contribute to the repo but you do for example talks on it you help on Slack with questions those things are not getting counted but you can still vote if that issue that is linked there also have a form and that you can say like hey I wanted to be able to vote because I am actually involved in this project. So you can do this until the 24th. So you have like two more days to be able to say I want to be able to vote. Uh and this way on Monday you will will you can actually do the voting. >> Yeah. So then take your chances. Uh if you open the voting links on 27, go on 27. >> Yes. >> Yeah. And in general like how how would you go about deciding who to vote for and how many people can you vote for? So this year so in total the GC is composed by nine people and each term is two years. So one year five people come out the next year four people come out. So this year is so we have like five spots. So there are currently 10 people uh 10 candidates. Uh so you can vote because there are five spots. You can vote uh for five different people or you can just vote five times for me. That also works. No, that that is for not possible. Yeah, but that's awesome. Um yeah, so October 27, we even have a nice little URL thing here for you. Um gradfan hotel vote. It's really just to the voting one, but you should be voting for Meria and Ted. They're awesome. Can vouch for the fact that they're good people as well, aside from their contributions, which speak for themselves. >> Thank you. >> Was there anything else that you wanted to say, Merilia? >> No, I think it's if you are really interested about the classic config, check it out, play a little. And if you also just want to be a contributor to hotel, uh check the the Slack channel Hotel new contributor. Uh join Sigs and listen. We are always welcoming to people if you want to help with the Python with the logs and apparently. >> Oh no, I knew you'd come back to invite me. >> Join join. >> Oh, I have a question for you before we we go. Like if there was if you had a magic wand, this is the magic wand question. If you could change one thing and it just like don't worry about how difficult it is to implement. If you could just get it done, what what would that be in the hotel world? >> I wanted to be able with just one click have my application instrumented like it can identify what are the I don't know all the tools that I'm using. I don't have to like initialize and it just looks for me like identify and just set up everything for me. So it's the declar config plus like you don't even have to create the file. They create the file for you and initialize this. Yeah. Yeah. I would I would say something very similar except I want to go even further. I don't just wanted to instrument things like I want I want like I don't want to have to set up graphana either. I want the dashboards already up. I want the analysis there. I want alerting setup. Like basically, I don't want to have to care about the tool. I don't want to have to choose or tweak anything. I just want to be like, "Yes, go." >> Yeah. I just want like hear a voice that tells me like, "Oh, now something is down and this is how you fix it on your system." That is >> And I also want it to cost nothing. >> Yes, >> of course. Okay, you've gone too far. That's the line and you crossed it. That would be awesome. Okay. Well, everyone, thank you for for joining us. Thank you both for joining me and answering all my all my beginner questions. Um, if you if anyone watching has any feedback about this style of of series leader and I are just starting this, this is literally number one. We want to talk about all the ways that that graphfana and open telemetry intersect and we also want to talk about like how to get started with open telemetry whether you're using graphana or not there's a lot of like beginner concepts that I'm personally interested in digging into. So if you had feedback on that just leave them in the comments and and we we do look at those and we do act on those. Um, and again on October 27, please vote for Merilia Gutierrez and Ted Young. >> Awesome. >> Thanks everyone. >> Thank you everyone. Thank you for having me. >> All right. Have a good week rest of your
