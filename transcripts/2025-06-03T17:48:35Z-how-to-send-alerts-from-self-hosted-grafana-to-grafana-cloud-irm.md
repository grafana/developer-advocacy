# Sending Alerts from Grafana to IRM

Hi everyone, I am Pepe, a developer advocate at Grafana. In this quick demo, I'll show you how to send specific alerts from a local Grafana instance to IRM on Grafana Cloud.

**Step 1: Set Up Integration in Grafana Cloud IRM**

1. In Grafana Cloud IRM, go to the **Integration** tab.
2. Click on **Add Integration**.
3. Choose the type **Alert Manager**.
4. Give it a name and, optionally, assign it to a team.
5. You may want to choose an **escalation chain** to handle all the alerts coming to this integration.
6. Finally, on this page, copy the **RE endpoint** for this integration.

**Step 2: Configure Contact Point in Local Grafana**

Now, switch over to your local Grafana:

1. Go to **Contact Points** in **Alerting**.
2. Click on **Create Contact Point**.
3. Give it a name.
4. Select the type **Webhook** and enter the URL of the IRM integration.

**Step 3: Test the Integration**

Now let's test the integration quickly:

1. Click on **Send Test Notification**.
2. Don't forget to set the contact point.

**Step 4: Verify in IRM**

Now back in IRM, you will find an incoming alert group. You can click to view the details. From here, you can:

- Acknowledge
- Resolve
- Take additional actions

On the timeline, we can see how this alert group was handled by the escalation chain. I already received a phone call and an email.

And that's all for this quick demo! 

The next step is for you to decide which alerts you want to forward to IRMâ€”whether all of them or only some of them.
