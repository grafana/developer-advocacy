Transcript: hello graph Antics have you ever worked with data which doesn't fit any pretty graph Circle image or any other flashy visualization you may be longing for a traditional spreadsheet to just to be able to look at all those data fields numbers or statuses if that is the case table panel visualizations come to the rescue and today we will Deep dive into them what are them how to create them and work with them the main settings and configurations that you can Define on the [Music] now a table panel visualization in grafana is a powerful tool for representing tabular data in the structured and a customizable format which in other words means that this panel displays data in columns and rows again very similar to a spreadsheet as it comes as well with functionalities such as sorting paginating grouping and filtering so many features and the cherry on top is that the table panel is incredibly powerful in its customizations you can do powerful formatting conditional styling and much much more I would dare to say with table panels imagination is the limit of what you can do with this powerful visualization type and with this awesome description I am sure that you may be looking forward to finding out more about them so let's get ahead and start working with table [Music] panels first we will add the table panel to do so we need to access or create a dashboard where we will create the panel inside the dashboard you can always add a new panel with the upper ad button and by selecting visualization if you have a new or clean dashboard you will have a huge middle button for that once you click it if this is your first panel in the dashboard you will be asked to select a data source to pull the data into the table panel here like most panel visualizations you can select one or multiple options but for this example we will use a data source everyone has in their grafana instance the test data data source for more information about it check the link in the corner now click on the test data data source to select it you will now see a screen with lots of options and a no data message this is the Pano editor screen but hey this is not the graph that we are looking for right by default graph shows you a Time series panel to change it into the table panel go to the panel display options of the panel editor click on the upper right drop down and search or type for the table option and click on it there we go but um still no data well we haven't selected any let's select below something apt for a multicolumn table let's say an exponential heat map Source type or maybe a flame graph or logs or even a CSV data source we can play around with the scenarios available in the test data data source and see how each information bit is displayed the visualization preview section will update dynamically with this changes but just a note as you will find out annotations alerts and a few others are not supported by the table panels but do not worry the vast majority of data is supported by it you can also use multiple data sources such as low key Prometheus influx DV Microsoft SQL server graphites and many many many more but for Simplicity we will use the CSV scenario loading the adom Mobile's file from the test data source now let's click on apply to get it back to the main dashboard and there you have it a table panel well a not so pretty table panel I would say but we can change that before we go on customizing it we can play with it already by clicking on the column title to easily sort the data right away it is sortable ain't that cool we can also scroll vertically and horizontally to see the card data we have as yeah we have a lot lots of data all right uh this is too much data and it doesn't look so pretty so let's dive into what we can custom [Music] cze let's click on the three dots of the panel and select edit to access a panel editor here we will be able to customize several things in our table panel first below the image if the information that is displayed is too much or not exactly what we wanted in our panel we can play with the query or queries of the panel for now we won't D too much on this as quering is a deep topic but in this area you can change queries to bring Only The Columns that we want and we can also transform the data in the end make sure that you get rows and columns that you need for your data in the right section of the panel editor the panel display options have several things that appeared when we selected the table panel the first thing as with almost all panels is the panel title description links and repeat options these are the general panel settings and for more information about them check check the link in the corner for now we will just modify the title let's put on it the table panel video nice now getting inside of the table options the first element is the show header switcher this will pull the column or fi name from your query and display it on top of each one of the columns and as I like those indications I want to keep it turned on the next element is the cell height to change how tall you can switch uh between small medium and large I want to keep things in medium how about that now the next element is the enable pagination option this means that if you have many rows of data you won't be scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and since it seems like we have lots of cars here I want it active W actually we had a lot all right next we have a minimum and normal commum width by default the values are 150 and AO the auto value means that grafana assigns the size we see based on the table size and the minimum width but I want it smaller the minimum is useful when you open grafana on small screens or you have too many columns we don't want those columns to be ridiculously thin in our mobile devices right by rule grafana lets you go for 50 as the smallest so I will set them to 50 and 100 as I want to see more columns next is the column alignment which in itself it's very explanatory right and I want everything centered following up we have the column filter option this will let your users do all sorts of filtering very much in a spreadsheet style I like to give power to the user so let's keep it now in the table footer section we have the option to display well a footer once activated it will add a row at the bottom with all sorts of calculations and fond information regarding the data in our table grafana will display it on all the numeric columns but below you can select if you want to have it only on one or two or more I don't think we need this for now but now you know how to use it let's turn it off now moving on to the font section here in the cell options is where you can change the cell type which by default is in auto mode which means plain text but in this auto mode you can activate cell value inspect which will add a tiny eye at the corner on each one of those super long values that you cannot see in a single column H over it and you will be able to see it and that's it for auto let's keep moving click on the cell type to find all the available views the first one is a sparkline which renders a value series and gives you all the series options but we need specific data types and the time series to table data transformation for it that is a deep topic so if you want more information Link in the corner let's move on to the next one now the color text once selected you will see the value inspect options as well the data will be colorful now the colors defined use the thresholds that are defined at the bottom as you can see the panel came with some defaults anything over 80 will be read and otherwise the base will be green thresholds are also a topic on themselves and for more information on them link on the corner as usual moving on we have the colored background pretty much the same as the previous only that the background is what is colored uh instead of the text the only extra here is that you have the option of adding some gradient to this color check plain shiny plain shiny okay let's keep it that all right moving on we have the gouch option after we select it you will see some colorful bars next to our data these bars or gouges can be set to different types basic bars with lines gradients or LCD you can also modify the value or text is displayed you can completely remove it and leave just the gouch or you can also set it to the default text color of the table or also you can set it to the value gou color again all these colors are defined by the thresholds but a note the gouge sizes will be set as the maximum number that appears on the whole table next we have the Json view which shows values for mat as code for that we need to quickly change our cars into some Json if a value is an object the Json view allows browsing the Json object which will appear once you hover over it nice right okay let's go back to the original data moving on we have the image view if you have field values that are an image URL or a B 64 encoded image you can configure the table to display them as an image let's change this to a clean CSV so that we can add something that I want let's grab some images URL and paste it there yay we have an image inside of our table and there you have it the rest of the options below are standard panel options for more information on them please check the link in the corner and you may be wondering that is great and all but uh the whole table changed while I was moving the settings I want each column to be different and unique well worry no more let's find out how we can make each column look the best according to it it the secret is at the bottom of the all section of the panel display options there we have the add field overright button there lies the secret also you can select the tab for the overrides where you can also add them and where they will be exclusively displayed they will be on both sides so first we will click on the ad field override buttton there we can pick the way in which we want to select the column or field that we want to customize personally I like to pick them by name but if you want to explore all the ways that you can do this check the link in the corner now selecting it by name let's select the miles per gallon the first thing that we could do is uh just hide the column if this is too much and we don't want to know the miles we can hide it but no miles are important I want to keep it but keep it in mind if you want to hide a column you can use overwrites to do so or as well you can filter them from your query or even hide them with a data transformation but moving on uh we must click on the add override property button and from there select whatever we would like to modify on what we configured earlier let's make it more visible then and change the cell options and cell type to gouch you will see all the gouch options that we described earlier one selected so I will just pick an LCD because I like LCDs A Lot H now I think it is uh not wide enough as the mileage is very important to me so let's add one more and now select the column width and set it to let's say 300 nice very visible now we can even add thresholds just for that column in the same way now I want to modify the column for the country as it seems to why to me let's create a new overwrite same selecting it by name selecting the country now we add a property and the column width let's do 50 now it's not so overwhelming right nice when we create overrides the mean Fields will indicate to you which ones are affected by a blue dot the blue dot will appear next to the main fields that had an override on them so that you are not crazy looking for like I wait this is not changing and there you have it a table panel visualization that is very colorful and pretty now go ahead and create table visualization panels in your own dashboards if you have any questions or
