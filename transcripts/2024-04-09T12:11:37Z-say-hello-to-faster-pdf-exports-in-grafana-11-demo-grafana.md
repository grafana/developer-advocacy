Transcript: Hi. I'm Agn√®s Toulet, a senior software engineer on the
Grafana Sharing Team at Grafana Labs. Let's talk about major PDF improvements
available in public preview in Grafana 11 from May 13th. So why did
we make this change? Well, aren't you tired of waiting for your
PDF to be generated or your report to be sent? So generation time will no longer be
proportional to the number of panels in your dashboard. As an example, an SLO dashboard containing around 200
panels has gone from taking more than seven minutes to be
generated to only 11 seconds. This update also fixes all caveats
related to rendering reports with panels or rows set to repeat
by a variable like rendering, repeating panels inside collapse
row. So how does it work? Exactly as before. Once you have enabled
the new PDF rendering feature to go, any PDF will be generating
using this new rendering feature. Thank you.
