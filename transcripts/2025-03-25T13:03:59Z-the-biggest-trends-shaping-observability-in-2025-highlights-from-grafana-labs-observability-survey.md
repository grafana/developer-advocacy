Transcript: Hi everyone.
Tom from Grafana Labs here. I'm really excited to announce the
launch of our third annual Observability Survey. This time we had 1,200 respondents from
across the industry and around the world all contributing to
some amazing insights. The first major insight from our
Observability Survey was around open source and
how it continues its real dominant role in the
observability market. And a remarkable 75% of respondents
are using open source and open license technology in their
observability strategy now. With 70% of respondents saying they're
using Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, and 50% of respondents, or 50% of those at least,increasing their
investment now for a second year in a increasing their investment
now for a second year in a row. The second big trend that stood out
this year was executive involvement, and we've seen it particularly accelerate
with three courses of all companies saying observability is business critical
and visible at the exec level with the CTO in particular being the most engaged.
We do also see that the companies that responded to this questionnaire with
strong executive involvement are also the ones kind of adopting the more advanced
practices and tools around tracing, profiling, things like
SLOs and so on. So the third big trend
was desire for AI to really tame a lot of the complexity
coming out of observability. A lot of people responded about wanting
to respond to incidents faster, get to root cause more quickly,
and wanting to do things like train AI based on their alerts they get to really
kind of filter the signal from the noise.  And last but not least, cost
management remains really important. Three quarters of the companies said cost
is one of the most important criteria when selecting
observability tech, but key is that they're not just looking
for the cheapest option here, right? They're looking for the option that
maximizes the amount of value and utility they can get from their tools at a
fair and reasonable price.  So yeah, they're the four main
takeaways from our observability survey. If you want to find out more,

analysis of the report. We also have a really cool interactive
dashboard on play.grafana.com where you can go and slice
and dice the data yourself. Thank you very much.
