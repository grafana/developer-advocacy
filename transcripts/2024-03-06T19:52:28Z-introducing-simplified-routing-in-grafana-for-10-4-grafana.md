Transcript: [Music] hello everyone my name is Sonia gillar and I'm a senior software engineer on the alertin squad at graan Labs today I'm going to show you a new feature that we have built in our team that it's called simplified routing this will be available for open-source users from release 10.4 behind the feature toel and for cloud users we are going to enable this feature progress basically this will be only available for grafana manage alerts and for grafana alert manager from now in the AL rule form you can decide which routin approach you want to select for this Al Rule now in the configure notification step in the AL group form we have two tabs select contact point or use notification policy if you set set select contact point in this step now you can select the contact point where you want to send the notifications of this alert you can decide the rooting of your alert directly from the alert rule form all the alert notifications will be root directly to this contact point you don't need to do anything else Additionally you can also configure the root settings like new timings overwrite grouping and overwrite timings but this is optional let's take a look an example about this new routin option in the in the other definition the other on the left side you can see that we have set contact point one but we haven't set any rooting settings are as are they are optional however the other on the right side we have set some rooting settings this is the only difference between them regarding routing in simplified routing alerting how to generates special policies below a new special note in the policy 3 we have a new note in the tree that is collapsed by default and only admins will see this is the AOG generated policy policies note below this note we generate one policy for each contact point and in case an all rule is safe with different root settings from the defaults we generate a new nested policy for the contact point with a hash of the routing settings of the Y rule as you can see in here there is one instance root to the purple node with contact point one and there is other instance that has been sent to the blue one and you can see that in this one we are using the hash this is how it works internally and this is only shown for ad users it's important to note that all these autogenerated policies are read only and if admin wants to update something in there they will have to go to the AL rule form and update root fields in there and that's all thank you very much
