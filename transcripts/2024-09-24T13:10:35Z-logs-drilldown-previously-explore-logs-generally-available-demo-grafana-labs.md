Transcript: Hi, I'm Mat Ryer from Grafana Labs and I'm
excited to tell you today about Explore Logs: a new way to work
with your Loki log data. Explore Logs lets you diagnose incidents
in a fraction of the time all without writing queries. You just use
these beautiful interfaces. Let's check out Explore Logs. First,
we show you your logs by service. You can see at a glance a
picture of what's being logged, and this has filtering
built right in. In OTel, this would be the service name,
but you can use any label here. The log volume graphs often
show interesting spikes
that make it easy to filter out noise. Labels and fields are
presented with no need to query for them, and a simple way to drill down further. We intelligently prioritize
what graphs show up first, but you have a range of options
depending on your use case. For example, you could show outliers first, if you're looking for those
that look different to the rest. Patterns are extracted from your
logs at ingest time and are updated continuously. They represent the different
kinds of log lines in your streams. You can easily spot noisy debug lines
or exclude them to mute noise or include them to focus in. Advanced users can always open in
Explore any time to jump back to LogQL powering it all. So that's Explore Logs. Insights from your data are surfaced
immediately with a point-and-click interface for you to drill
down and investigate more. Use patterns to get rid of
noise or to focus in deeper. And the table view lets you cut your data
in different ways and look at it from different angles. The team are working on adding even more
insights into the log lines themselves, as well as smart ways to surface
the information that really matters. Thanks for watching. Check out the other Explore apps
posted alongside this video. Thank you.
