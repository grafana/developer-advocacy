## Summary

In this video, the presenter discusses effective strategies for seeking help in the Grafana Slack community, particularly regarding visualizations. They emphasize the importance of providing specific details such as the data source, visualization type, and Grafana version when asking for assistance. The presenter also suggests tips for helping others who may be seeking help. The focus is on enhancing communication and understanding within the community to improve problem-solving related to Grafana visualizations.

So, yeah, a little bit of what I wanted to talk about for this. Again, we'll probably move around and get cut off, but I want to share some of the best ways to get help when you ask questions in the Grafana Slack. I can also provide tips on what to do if you are being asked for help. Additionally, I have some sample content to go through if we want to dive into that.

To start, when you ask a question about visualizations or if you're trying to communicate to others what you're experiencing with visualizations, it's crucial to include certain details. First off, the **data source** and **visualization type** that you're using are both very important. These details can help us refine what the issue might be. If we're going to look something up, we need to know those two things.

Moreover, knowing **what version you're on** is also essential. You can find this information by clicking the little question mark at the top right. In Grafana OSS, you will see the actual version of Grafana, and in Grafana Cloud, there's a little indicator for the version as well.
