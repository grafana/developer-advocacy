Transcript: Hi, my name is Adella and I'm an engineer
on the DataViz Squad at Grafana Labs. Today I'm excited to announce that state
timeline visualization now supports pagination. This is a useful feature for
visualizations that have many series. Previously, all the series in a state timeline were
made to fit within the single window of the panel, which could
make it hard to read. The page size option allows you to
paginate the state timeline by limiting how many series are visible at
once. With paginated results, the visualization displays a
subset of all series on each page. This feature is a community contribution. Thanks from the DataViz Squad at Grafana.
