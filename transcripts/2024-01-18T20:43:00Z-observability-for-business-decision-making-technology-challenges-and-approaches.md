Transcript: cool man so you know following on from our last conversations you know basically we spoke a lot about the challenges and the way we are moving in this world one of the scenarios that you know you mentioned right I've got some technical uh implementation questions like how do people start when they are working with Legacy systems and procedures now in my view Legacy environments present quite a bit of a challenge um from creating a culture as well as you know creating this OB obility environment and the problem is not just technical implementation because what I found a lot and especially things like cobal there's no libraries there's nothing available so people are very quick to just say no we're not going to do anything because there's nothing so the challenge that comes in that we have to think about is what is available um and is it Justified because if a system is running for let's say 20 years old like a cobal system just just to go and instrument the system is what is the risk investment and what is the risk of changing code and deploying it so we have to think about all of these things but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing it what I usually recommend is as a organization start by making a decision that we won't develop code or deploy anything that is not instrumented so the only time when these systems typically get deployed is if something changes or there's bugs so at that point in time to fix those things do some instrumentation add it because it is worthwhile to monitor it but start there because that starts building the culture so not just okay we're not going to do it just draw the line and work from that line forward not don't try and catch everything up interesting so on the decision to make you know observability part of vars as it would ensure you have metrics and all new code in the future I would typically say yes all new code the catch however is if you fix a bug that's still new code but I wouldn't spend the time to go and catch up everything because there's no return of investment but going forward start catching up no that's good to hear so as you said starting somewhere is always vital right and making the journey easy and simple essential right I mean good point about Cobalt right I mean you know how many banks are still running Cobalt in the backand right and you know you got developers who've been working on it since the' 70s still working there so you know it is interesting so have you seen similar challenges with environments where it's digital first and supported by modern approaches what we've seen there is similar things sometimes because the tools are there but people just don't take that step forward but what we see there is there's a lot of tools it's not just coming into a place and saying all right we've got one logging tool or one instrumentation tool there's a lot and typically if you look at the offerings from these tools they overlap and the part that sometimes scares me a little bit is you get these drag and drop Solutions whereby the sales line says just install this and kind of we'll do the rest and we'll just instrument and weave our code in and then suddenly you get all of these magic results the problem with that one is where's the Contex next so all of these tools do add value but the part to be careful of is that options is overwhelming as well as the data as well as the notifications and as you very well know the moment you start overloading people with notifications they get desensitized and the importance of the notification just goes lost so the problem with these things is it's out of control and there's just too much and and that's what we have to be very careful of yeah that's true that's a very good point I mean you know I think if you bring up a chart on the set of tools that are available out there for any it you know observability uh specialist you know the child will just blow the screen away with all the different solutions out there right and uh yeah no mistake right there's a lot of great tools out there they all add value but the challenge as we all know is that they all carry a cost of Maintenance and you know cognitive overload if they need to be better managed yeah all of these things push for our attention data I mean it's why do we write softwares you know for people's attention and data so we have to be very careful of striking healthy balance between what is valuable what is data what is too much and basically just how to interpret all of this information all the time to make it useful otherwise it's just a massive amount of noise yeah that's right and and there how much believe it or not we are in 2023 and you know after all the tools that have been out there implemented everywhere people are still having a challenge on finding the right answer so are these are these are there some recommendations you usually provide to clients or colleagues that help overcome these challenges and get them started you know uh you know either they're on the journey to observability or they think they are already on the journey but get them on the right track I think the first point and and really happy to share the this information because I think it's really important at least from my perspective where I'm sitting with clients is take a step back and understand what is your intent with what you're trying to instrument it's not just here's a lot of data and we hope for the best what is your strategy sometimes called even a data strategy then get the skills and make sure you can maintain and progress the solution especially dashboards notifications because we often see Consultants like myself come in we do a lot of work and when this gets handed over it kind of stops there so this needs to be progressed it's a living system so as a consultant what I usually recommend is get somebody in there just to set up a bit of a baseline help you to instrument some of the systems and gain the knowledge because then you know what this means it doesn't address the business problem as yet but get some runs on the board and get some wins in there the responsibility of the consultant is to make sure that the solution is not dependent on the consultant so very important that skills transfer but as we discussed a little bit earlier that's the easy part that's the technical side and anybody can actually kind of do that part however now let's think about the business side and that's slightly more complicated because you have to look at this in two ways at least the way that I approach it is firstly look forward to what may affect your customer Journeys and then Look Backwards of what has affected you so far and it gives you these two things let's look at the backward side first typically what are the top 10 things that has affected you so far this can be outages downtime things that were slow things that affected the customers and it's not always fun to look at these things but it gives you a good starting point to say let's instrument these because this might happen again this does definitely doesn't cover all of it but it's a good starting point it gives you a bit of a checklist to go down also it proves the promise because with observability we make all of these Grand promises about having this data real time and visibility around these things so this proves the promise that remember that thing that happened two weeks ago now we can keep an eye on it so good starting point then looking forward what are the things that is important to business in these customer Journeys that might affect them and typically these there's not a lot maybe it's a payment site maybe it's somebody logging in maybe it's customer sorry not customer but website response um search these things if these things can affect business result instrument them and get them on the chart because then business knows how to handle things that happened previously but they also have a eye on things that can come up that can affect their business now if you consider all of these things whereby you have to think about going backwards and going forwards and having all different systems and all of these different people you can understand why I've always relied you know personally even you know many years ago why I rely on gryffon and Prometheus across the board to actually do this observability approaches because although these things can provide you with a bit of a light touch approach these things are attended as a starting point to be tactical lowcost and able to support future requirements because a lot of times we get these tools and you have to spend so much to get the tool up and running and do so much investment and there's not a lot of results yet so start small grow and build from there but what I've always done is you use these tools I democratize all the data establish this endtoend observ capability for all the levels in the organization so from execs through to managers through to developers and they can all see the value of this so if you take all of these tools everything and instrument it build it help them where they are you meet the industry and your clients where they are not where the tool thinks they should be or if you do this then we can do this using this we can meet them where they are and again prove the promise so my recommendation is look forwards Look Backwards start small and be able to grow cool very insightful very knowledgeable thanks Corell always appreciate your support here awesome thank you so much J let's catch you soon
