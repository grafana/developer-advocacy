Guest:: "Salva Corts Sánchez"

## Pre-show checklist

- [ ] Create a new `.md` file and copy this template into it. Check things off as you work through it.
- [ ] Update [Grafana Office Hours Readme](projects/Grafana%20Office%20Hours/Grafana%20Office%20Hours%20Readme.md) to add the new file to the `Upcoming` section.
- [ ] Contact the guest and tell them about Office Hours.
	> At Grafana Labs, we do a livestream called [Grafana Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk7NoagbJ28&list=PLDGkOdUX1Ujrrse-cdj20RRah9hyHdxBu), where we have guests on to talk about how to use Grafana, observability, or visualization. I saw your [blog post/video/post] on [source] and I think it would be great to have you on the show to share your experience about [topic].
	Office Hours is an hour-long live conversation that is streamed to the [Grafana YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@grafana). It's very casual, and you can also share your screen if you'd like to do a demo (not required). If you'd like to join, I'd love to have you! 
- [ ] If the guest agrees, choose a date for the Office Hours session. Check [the Monday board](https://grafana-labs.monday.com/boards/5724430500) to make sure no other livestream is scheduled for that day. Add a card for that date and time to save the spot.
- [ ] Confirm the time (16:00 CEST on Friday is generally best) with the guest. Ask them for a photo you can use for promotion, or ask for permission to use their profile pic on social media.
- [ ] Invite them to the Grafana Office Hours calendar invite (choose "this instance only", not the whole series). Schedule the invite for 15 minutes before the stream (to do a tech check) until 15 minutes after the stream (to debrief). The invite should be for 1.5 hours total. Explain this to them.
- [ ] Create a thumbnail on [Canva](https://canva.com) using the Grafana Office Hours thumbnail format. Use [thumbsup.tv](https://thumbsup.tv) to check how the thumbnail looks on different devices. [Here are some guidelines for creating thumbnails](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Create+engaging+thumbnails).
- [ ] Schedule the broadcast on [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com), and select the Grafana YouTube channel as the destination.
	- [ ] In the title, include the instance of Office Hours, i.e. `What's new in Grafana 10? (Grafana Office Hours #01)`. Including the number or the date (such as `All About Explore Logs (Loki Community Call November 2024`) helps people remember it.
	- [ ] Add the standard description as per previous Grafana Office Hours shows. Check the video description and add guests' contact details.
- [ ] Get familiar with how to use Streamyard. [Here's a crash course on how to use Streamyard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hb8FeoO88zinZu638MfnBwGctyspgfm0/view?usp=drive_link) and [here's a second recorded call with the Grafana Campfire hosts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hdX4SvDM67KRwGkzA6HWEETK1-gy8iUk/view?usp=drive_link) to get them onboarded with Streamyard. These include how to create the stream on Streamyard.
- [ ] Get the Streamyard invite link and put it in the "location" of the calendar invite to the guest.
- [ ] Get the YouTube link to the show. Put the link on this page, in the URL property above.
- [ ] Create an event and announce it [on the Grafana Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/grafana-friends-virtual-meetup-group/).
- [ ] Schedule posts on socials just when the show begins to say "We're live now!" [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) is a good free tool to use for this. Set it up for your socials and be sure to tag/mention the official Grafana account-- they'll usually boost/repost it if you do.
- [ ] Schedule a Slack message on the internal Grafana workspace (in `#community`, `#content-video`, `#video-offsite-2025-futurism`, and anywhere else you think it might be relevant). Yes this is excessive. Let's change this process!
- [ ] Schedule a Slack message on the public Grafana Slack workspace (in the appropriate channel, such as `#loki` or `#announcements`).
- [ ] Add your call to the Community Calendar (ask David, Richi, Nicole, and Usman).
- [ ] Think of any reference links you might want to give the audience. Add it to the YouTube description.

## Talking points

> Enumerate talking points for the show. It's better to keep these as bullet points to encourage a more casual, rather than scripted, conversation.

- Intro
- Announcements
	- New Loki Helm Maintainers: Mike Timmerman and Quentin Bisson
	- Loki Helm: `kubectl` removed [in this PR](https://github.com/grafana/loki/pull/18803) to remove the tokengen part in conjunction with the deprecation of the Bitnami image
- Introduce guest: Salva
- Thanks to Grafana Champions for their questions:
	- Avanish Vaghela
	- Andre Ziviani
	- Mike Timmerman
### Basics of structured metadata

- What is structured metadata?
	- What does "structured" mean? What format does the metadata have to be in?
	- What's the difference between structured metadata and labels?
	- Why do we need structured metadata? 
		- Can't everything just be a label? (+ what happens when we have high cardinality)
		- Enables correlation between telemetry signals
	- When should we use it instead of a label or just searching through the log line?
- What are some ideal use cases for structured metadata?
	- Search and filtering
	- correlation between telemetry signals
	- alerting
        - What does LogQL query look like with structured metadata?
- Which collectors currently support structured metadata
	- Alloy
	- Otel collector inherited via the otlp endpoint -> segway
### Practices for structured metadata

- OTel and structured metadata
	- What does structured metadata have to do with OTel?
	- What are OTel attributes and are they all stored as structured metadata?
        - In Loki OSS we allow users to control structured metadata promotion. Can you tell us how this works?
        - Can you also do this in Grafana Cloud?
- Best practices for structured metadata
	- OTel semantic conventions
	- be selective about labels
	- keep structured metadata structured
	- include correlation IDs in all signals
	- don't include sensitive data
	- use resource attributes for stable metadata (tag at source level rather than repeating for every log)
- What *shouldn't* we do with structured metadata?
	- Should you omit the attribute from your log body if you have added it to structured metadata?
	- Should the data extracted from the log lines as structured metadata be removed from the log body to avoid duplication of data?
	- Should all OTel log and resource attributed be added as structured metadata?
	- What happens if you have tiny log line with a lot of structured metadata?
	- Does `loki_distributor_bytes_received_total` contain the structure metadata bytes as well or should `loki_distributor_structured_metadata_bytes_received_total`  be combined to see the total volume received?
	- when is it too much metadata?
- Is there a difference in resource consumption or performance when querying structured metadata vs. querying labels?
	- Impact of ingesting large amount of structured metadata
	- Is there a thing as too much structured metadata? What's the ideal ratio for size of log line bytes vs structured metadata bytes.
	- Does it have a read latency implication when logs contain large amount of structured metadata?
	- What's the overhead in compute (query and ingestion) and storage?

### Future of structured metadata in Loki 4.0

- (Mike Zimmerman) I like structed metadata now, but with the next releases of Mimir and Loki redesigining ingestion to include kafka, which I've heard is being done with the intention to support more labels (IE indexes), it has me wondering if it will shift the meta.  Will the use cases for structured metadata change?  I ask this having not done much research on use cases beyond my own.

- Outro
	- If people want to learn more about this topic, where should they go?

### Just before the show

> Here are some points to discuss with the guest in the 15 minutes before the stream begins.

- [x] How do you pronounce your name?
- [ ] What are your pronouns?
- [ ] We will be using the talking points, but we don't have to be strict about it. We don't have to go through all of them, or follow a specific order. They're only there to make us comfortable.
- [ ] Does anyone want to share their screen? We can do that now, and I can show you how that works
- [ ] We'll be streaming to YouTube.
- [ ] You'll be able to see comments, but if you have links, I have to paste it into the private chat.
- [ ] You can also use the private chat if you need to say something, but you can also just say it out loud.
- [ ] If at any point you aren't comfortable talking about something, please either say so or let me know in the private chat, and I'll pivot away from that topic.
- [ ] Afterwards, we'll say goodbye to the stream, but please stay on past that so we can debrief.
- [ ] Just in case I disconnect... stall for a minute and I'll be right back.

## Post-show checklist

- [ ] Add timestamps to the video (at least four).
- [ ] Add any links shared to the description of the video.
- [ ] Add YouTube cards when relevant to certain points during the video.
- [ ] Add the video to video playlists that make sense (at the very least, the "Grafana Office Hours" one.)
- [ ] Download all videos for the recording on Streamyard and upload it [to this shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sLnnYzmphet7K7QwogcZrYDI-Re07HS4) in the appropriate folder.
- [ ] Think about how you could repurpose this content. [This Loki Community Call](https://youtube.com/live/XJMQbEuBeMc) on Explore Logs was turned into [these](https://youtube.com/shorts/6RfI5UeJo08) [two shorts](https://youtube.com/shorts/jx1DATkGIz4) (*Short - Grafana Cloud Explore Apps for no-code querying of Loki, Mimir, Tempo, Pyroscope* and *Short - How to enable Explore Logs app for Grafana*) and [this shorter video](https://youtu.be/eXwE2vqLcyY) (*How to use the Explore Logs app for Grafana*) + docs.
- [ ] Update [Advocate Contributions sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LataDRRX4DZy8VnCiBDXmynjmpOJdibM7ek_uvpim4Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0) with your work.
