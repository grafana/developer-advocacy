### Just before the show

> Here are some points to discuss with the guest in the 15 minutes before the stream begins.

- [x] How do you pronounce your name?
- [x] We will be using the talking points, but we don't have to be strict about it. We don't have to go through all of them, or follow a specific order. They're only there to make us comfortable.
- [x] Does anyone want to share their screen? We can do that now, and we can show you how that works.
- [x] We'll be streaming to YouTube.
- [x] You'll be able to see comments, but if you have links, we have to paste it into the private chat.
- [x] You can also use the private chat if you need to say something, but you can also just say it out loud.
- [x] If at any point you aren't comfortable talking about something, please either say so or let us know in the private chat, and we'll pivot away from that topic.
- [x] Afterwards, we'll say goodbye to the stream, but please stay on past that so we can debrief and upload the local recording.
- [ ] Just in case one of us disconnects... the rest should stall for a minute and we'll be right back.
