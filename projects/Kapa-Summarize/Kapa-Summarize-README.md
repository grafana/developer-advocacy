# Kapa Summarize Readme

## Problem

1. Multiple threads on [The Community Forum](https://community.grafana.com) get long, and complicated, become popular, but are unanswered
2. Even when they contain good information, they're very hard to sift through
3. Ideally, we would have summaries of all of the good advice posted there.

## Solution Approach

We do have the [Kapa Discourse Solver](https://github.com/grafana/kapa-discourse?tab=readme-ov-file#solver) that can do this.

1. Use the tooling there to fetch/summarize threads
2. Have a human edit the response
3. Post that response, mark as the solution to the thread, and close the thread.
4. Do this only for threads that are old, complex, highly viewed, and unsolved.
