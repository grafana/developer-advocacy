# Advocate video porduction

In this section you will find instructions, recommendations and standards to ease the production of new videos for YouTube and other mediums for Grafana Labs.

There are multiple elements, images, audio files and other items you can use to create the videos. Below is a quick check list with instructions that will guide you through the process.

## Check list

- Work in the folder available in this [shared Grafana GDrive ExplainerVideos folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1VLT46sWItUP2jGAt3XJbTPqC0nzVFgJj)
- The folder has 2 sub folders
    - Explainer templates - The resources that should be used in the videos
    - Videos - The list of videos in process
- Create a new folder inside of the "Videos" folder and name it with the video description
- Copy from the ExplainerVideos/ExplainerTemplates folder the ScriptTemplate file into your newly created folder and rename it as the video/episode title.
- Inside the file you just copied, as you progress you can update the marked elements such as video title, YouTube video Description, Cards, etc.
    - SCRIPT: Use the example script to write what you will say in your video. This can be used later as a guide or a teleprompter text.
    - TITLE: Review with the video team what is the best title for your video. This can be pasted verbatim.
